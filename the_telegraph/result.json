    "Garbage-lined streets and overflowing drains across Salt Lake have sparked fear of an outbreak of enteric diseases and are forcing residents to keep the windows and doors of their houses firmly shut.",
    "Residents said most of the 150 tonnes of the garbage Salt Lake generates every day is accumulating across the 33.5sq km township.",
    "“At this rate, Salt Lake will soon become Dhapa. This is happening at a time the authorities as well as residents need to focus on hygiene to combat Covid and dengue,” said a resident, hand firmly on his nose.",
    "“It is true that garbage has accumulated in some places but I don’t think it is a big problem. We will clear it within seven days,” said Debasish Jana, the mayoral council member in charge of solid waste management at the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation.",
    "Asked why the civic body has not yet been able to solve a “simple problem”, Jana said: “Several of our trucks are out of order, but our sweepers are at work all day. It’s just that accumulated garbage isn’t being removed regularly from a few areas.”",
    "For five days a week, Buddhadeb Basu, a resident of DB block, near City Centre, is having to dump household waste at the neighbourhood compactor station overflowing with garbage. He doesn’t have a choice. His neighbours, too, are doing the same.",
    "“Civic workers would previously collect garbage from our doorstep every day. Now they come hardly twice a week. They are not even taking away garbage from near the compactor station. The entire area stinks,” the 62-year-old told ",
    "The Telegraph",
    ".",
    "This newspaper drove around the township on Monday and found scarcely any block or compactor station that did not have a heap of garbage lying around.",
    "The areas near City Centre and the CGO Complex looked the dirtiest. The situation was similar in the AE, AB, BC, BB, and IC blocks.",
    "A 20-metre stretch from the City Centre Metro station till Bidhannagar College had almost half the carriageway swallowed by garbage. The entire area had flies swarming around, while several dogs and cows were seen rummaging through the garbage for food.",
    "Passers-by were seen holding handkerchiefs on their noses despite wearing masks.",
    "“The stench from the garbage in front of our house is so overpowering that we keep the windows of our house shut,” said Prakash Agarwal, a resident of EC Block.",
    "A civic official blamed the combination of staff shortage and defunct garbage collection trucks for the sorry state of affairs.  “Many men are not reporting for work out of fear of contracting the coronavirus and also because local trains are not running,” the official said. “There used to be 250 sweepers. Now, there are only half that number.”",
    "Mayoral council member Jana said many workers who were involved in collection of garbage were now selling vegetables or involved in other activities. “We are trying to hire personnel but the pandemic is coming in the way,” he said.",
    "To add to the problem, sources said, many handcarts and vans have broken down."

    "The Bengal government will set up a plasma bank at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital to help conduct trials for plasma therapy for Covid-19.",
    "Doctors and health department officials welcomed the move but wondered how many people would agree to donate plasma after recovering from the disease. Only a few donors have come forward since clinical trials of plasma therapy were launched a few months back.",
    "The bank has been planned to help carry out trials by storing plasma cells — donated by people who have recovered from Covid-19 — before they are infused into patients undergoing treatment for the disease, said officials.",
    "Plasma collected from the blood of a person three to four weeks after he or she has recovered from Covid-19 is expected to contain anti-viral antibodies, said doctors. As part of the therapy, a patient gets 200ml of plasma, stored in -80 degrees Celsius, daily for two days. After a few days, the blood is analysed for immune-response.",
    "“We received Swasthya Bhavan’s nod on Sunday to set up the plasma bank,” said Prasun Bhattacharya, the head of the department of immunohaematology and blood transfusion at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, now a dedicated Covid treatment centre.",
    "“The bank will help us continue our clinical trials. We will require some time to create the necessary infrastructure for the bank to be fully functional,” he said.",
    "Over the past few weeks, experts in immunohematology and blood transfusion have been trying plasma therapy on patients with mild to moderate acute respiratory disease symptoms at the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata.",
    "The trial had begun following a nod from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, which had collaborated with the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Calcutta, for this initiative by the Bengal government.",
    "The first person to donate plasma for the trial was Monami Biswas. The 23-year-old postgraduate student of business management at the University of Edinburgh had tested positive after she arrived in Calcutta on her way home to Habra in North 24-Parganas in May.",
    "But, like in other parts of India, doctors and scientists in Calcutta are facing reluctance from potential donors.",
    "“Forty patients are supposed to get plasma as part of the trial that started in May. Till date, we have been able to infuse plasma into 10 patients and have managed to get 12 donors,” said one doctor involved in the trial.",
    "According to the health department, 15,235 people have recovered from Covid-19 in Bengal till Monday.",
    "A doctor said they had approached many who have recovered. “But most have turned down our requests. Some are scared they might catch the virus again if they come to donate plasma. A few were discouraged by family members from donating plasma,” the doctor said.",
    "“Stigma and fear of getting infected again are preventing many from donating plasma,” said Abhijit Chowdhury, a public health expert. “Many people who were infected by the coronavirus suffered trauma because they were ostracised by neighbours. Some suffered trauma because of the behaviour of a section of healthcare workers at the hospitals where they were admitted.”",
    "India’s first plasma bank was inaugurated at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, in Delhi’s Vasant Kunj on July 3.",
    "The same day, a brigadier who had tested positive for Covid-19 died at a Calcutta hospital. Sources said Brigadier Vikas Samyal, who was posted at Fort William, was subjected to plasma therapy at Command Hospital in Alipore at the last moment. The therapy apparently didn’t work.",
    "“Since trials are on, it wouldn’t be proper to comment on the outcome so far. But yes, plasma therapy cannot be tried on any Covid-19 patient anytime,” a doctor said."

    "“Our government tried to send Amphan compensation to affected persons in various corners (of the state) without wasting any time and as a result there have been a few problems and mistakes in some places. But those are being rectified. I have told my officials that no affected persons would be deprived of government aid. Do not try to do politics over it,” said Mamata on Monday during an interaction with representatives of the film fraternity at state secretariat Nabanna.",
    "The Opposition questioned Mamata’s “choice of words”.",
    "CPM MLA Sujan Chakraborty said: “The chief minister is downplaying the malpractices that have happened. She did not do what she had assured us in the all-party meeting. No lists (of beneficiaries) were put up in the blocks. If there was any problem with compensation, she should take legal action against those involved in the malpractices.”",
    "BJP state president Dilip Ghosh also accused the chief minister of “trying to downplay Amphan relief corruption in which her own party members are involved”. “People have understood how her party colleagues looted the money meant for the poor. As the corruption became clear to everyone from politicians to media persons, she is now admitting it but by downplaying the issue,” Ghosh added.",
    "After the all-party meeting on June 24, Mamata had asked the administration to look into all complaints and ensure genuine complainants got their due. She asked officials to put up beneficiary lists for transparency, but lists put up in Nandigram last week sparked fresh protests over names of Trinamul workers and their kin. The administration backtracked on displaying the lists. Trinamul has also asked ineligible beneficiaries to return the money or face legal action."

    "Some senior historians have raised questions on the BJP’s attempts to pitch Bhartiya Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee as the “Paschimbongeyr srishtikorta (the creator of West Bengal)” and “Bangalir rokk­hakorta (the protector of Bengalis)” in the run up to the Assembly polls in which the saffron camp is desperate to wrest the seat of power in the state.",
    "Given the current political climate in the state — in which even chief minister Mamata Banerjee chooses to be seen as honouring Mookerjee — and the country, the historians requested anonymity.",
    "“The Bharatiya Jana Sa­ngh (BJP’s predecessor) foun­der was a lot of things — some, rather admirable — but he was essentially a divisive exponent of raw Hindutva that did considerable damage to the nation towards the end of the British Raj,” said a Calcutta-based historian. ",
    "“The likes of Mookerjee, on the Hindu side, contributed significantly — just as the likes of Muhammad Ali Jinnah did on the Muslim side — to the Partition,” he added.",
    "The BJP celebrated Mookerjee’s 119th birth anniversary on Monday with programmes across the country.",
    "BJP national president J.P Nadda addressed a virtual rally for Bengal from Delhi on the occasion and referred to his life and works.",
    "Sources in the BJP state unit said the saffron camp would go big with Mookerjee in the run-up to the make-or-break Assembly polls.",
    "“If today Bengal is a part of India, it is because of Syama Prasad Mookerjee. Not only that, the fact that a large portion of United Punjab is today with India is also because of the voice raised by him,” said Nadda.",
    "But another historian pointed out that Mookerjee opposed the United Bengal plan — a proposal to transform undivided Bengal into an unpartitioned, sovereign state called the Free State of Bengal, without division on religious grounds — floated by Bengal premier Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy that received the backing of the likes of Sarat Chandra Bose and Kiran Shankar Roy.",
    "“Mahatma Gandhi was not opposed to it. Muhammad Ali Jinnah was open to the idea. Then Bengal governor Frederick Burrows supported it too. But opposition from the likes of Mookerjee went a long way in that falling through and Bengal being partitioned,” he said.",
    "“If his facilitation of Partition is considered, then Mookerjee was, indeed, one of the creators of West Bengal…. Also, we can’t forget that both Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose had reservations about his politics,” he added.",
    "A political scientist said he understood why the BJP thought Mookerjee could be a good platform for its Bengal campaign.",
    "“An upper caste, elite, ",
    "bhadralok",
    " statesman, Mookerjee ticks most of the right boxes for being deemed a great Bengali icon…. But the saffron camp’s attempt is with the objective of using his legacy in the current socio-political climate to ensure deeper penetration in the state ahead of 2021,” he said.",
    "He said the BJP was keen to use Mookerjee’s legacy in Bengal, where a majority of people still view it as a non-Bengali party that stands for the “Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan” vision.",
    "“At the same time, his unvarnished majoritarian views help the BJP’s communal, divisive agenda,” he said.",
    "“But even in Bengal, Mookerjee has always been a controversial figure,” he added, referring to protests in Calcutta in January against the Narendra Modi government’s decision to rename the Calcutta Port after him. The protesters said the port should instead be named after Bengal Renaissance patriarch Raja Rammohun Roy.",
    "A city-based historian, who was part of the protests, said several researchers considered Mookerjee as biased towards the British.",
    "“Mookerjee, as a minister of Bengal Province (1941-43) under (A.K.) Fazlul Haq’s coalition government, had helped suppress the Quit India movement here, out of his weakness for the Union Jack,” he said.",
    "He pointed out how during the “back-breaking” Bengal Famine of 1943-44, a principal concern of Mookerjee was that government-run canteens employed Muslim and Hindu “lower caste” cooks.",
    "“Mookerjee and his Hindu Mahasabha were preoccupied with how those cooks made it “impossible” for upper caste Hindus to eat without “breaking caste”. This, amid a disaster that killed over 30 lakh Bengalis,” he added.",
    " ",
    "BJP national president Nadda, who addressed the virtual rally for the party’s Bengal unit on the birth anniversary of Syama Prasad Mookerjee, credited him for the abrogation of Article 370 and the Citizenship Amendment Act.",
    "The stress on the two contentious issues made it apparent that the saffron camp wo­uld go to the Bengal Assembly polls with its divisive narrative.",
    "“It is of great pleasure that the leadership of Narendra Modi and the strategies of Amit Shah helped us get rid of Article 370, that one issue over which Syama Prasad Mookerjee sacrificed his life,” Nadda said in his speech from the BJP headquarters in New Delhi.",
    "“He fought for the rights of minorities from Bangladesh and Pakistan…We will have to implement the CAA in Bengal as a tribute to the vision of Syama Prasad,” Nadda added.",
    "Insiders in the BJP’s Bengal unit have indicated that given the state’s demography with around 30 per cent Muslim voters, the party’s chances of wresting power from the ruling Trinamul depend on the ability of the leaders to spin a narrative that will polarise the electorate. Most BJP leaders think the repeated mention of the role of the Modi-Shah duo in ensuring the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution and enactment of the CAA would create the necessary polarisation. ",
    "Shah, who had launched the series of virtual rallies for Bengal on June 9, had focused on the CAA and attacked Mamata Banerjee for opposing the new citizenship matrix.",
    "Nadda’s narrative on Monday started off from where Shah had left it. Nadda aligned the two contentious legislations with Mo­o­kerjee whom the party wants to pitch as a Bengali icon.",
    "“In 1953 Mukherjee told a press conference, ‘if 4 crore Muslims can live peacefully in a nation of 35 crore, why can’t 25 lakh Muslims live peacefully in Kashmir?’” Nadda said, explaining Mookerjee’s opposition to Article 370. ",
    "Speaking about Mookerjee’s contributions to the nation, Nadda asserted it was because of the efforts of the Jana Sangh founder that West Bengal and large parts of Punjab are with India.",
    "“It is due to Syama Prasad Mookerjee that Bengal and Punjab are with India. Otherwise, they would have gone to Pakistan during the Partition...”",
    "Nadda also blamed the country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for apparently denying an inquiry into Mookerjee’s death under mysterious circumstances in Srinagar jail in 1953.",
    "In the later half of his speech, Nadda accused the Mamata regime of degradation from the ethics and morals that Mookerjee had preached in his lifetime. ",
    "He also accused Mamata of not conforming to the rules of cooperative federalism, alleging that the state had not shared exact details of the Covid-19 situation in Bengal with the Centre.",
    "“They are willing to compromise on all fronts just to stay in power,” Nadda said referring to the Trinamul leadership. “We have to follow the path led by Syama Prasad Moo­kerjee and restore the pride of Bengal by removing the current government,” he added.",
    "Trinamul leader and state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee termed Nadda’s allegations baseless. “For the BJP what matters most is votes. They can go to any extent, from telling lies to disto­rting history. They want to destroy our culture and traditi­on. They want to thrust their culture and ideology on Bengalis and are trying to mislead the people of Bengal,” he said."

    "“Mamata’s announcement shows she has already started preparations for the next year’s Assembly elections while battling the spread of Covid-19. It is clear pandemic might restrict political parties from holding large rallies ahead of the polls, but the chief minister started her preparations in style with the announcement on Monday,” said a senior state government official.",
    "Sources in the public health engineering department said in the first phase of the project, it would focus on providing water supply connections to households in the so-called dry region of the state. Districts like Jhargram, West Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia, West Burdwan and parts of Birbhum are considered to be dry zones in the state.",
    "Trinamul did not put up a good show in those areas during the last Lok Sabha polls where the BJP wrested six seats. “The chief minister was clearly trying to woo the people living in the dry zones. She also tried to address the concerns in parts of Nadia, Murshidabad, Birbhum, North 24-Parganas and South 24-Parganas that are suffering from fluoride contamination by announcing the project,” said an official.",

But a section of the officials did not rule out the possibility of joining the Centre’s Jal Jeevan Mission, which aims to secure pipeline water supply to 1.37 crore rural households in Bengal and 18 crore rural households in the country.",

    "Progress must be put into context. This would be a prudent approach to take towards the findings of the Sample Registration System statistical report for 2018, which show, among other things, that 13 out of 22 Indian states for which data are available have fallen below replacement fertility levels. The survey does bear heartening news. Apart from laggard states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, others have indicated a preference for one- or two-child families, and the total fertility rates seem to have a direct correlation with women’s educational levels. For instance, while the TFR among graduate women was 1.7, it was 3.0 for those who have not received education. Significantly, the gender gap in terms of the infant mortality rate has been narrowing, with the sex ratio at birth rising by three points to 899 during 2016-18. Perspective, however, is crucial — viewing the same data in the light of other important findings, such as the startling figures recorded by the United Nations’ sexual and reproductive health agency, raises worrying concerns.",
    "The UN State of World Population report for 2020 shows that India accounts for 45.8 million of the world’s 142.6 million “missing females” — girls who went missing at birth — over the past 50 years. How is the slight improvement in the sex ratio to be reconciled with damning evidence that the preference for sons and biased sex selection practices continue to hold firm sway in India? Sex-selective abortion was outlawed years ago, but the implementation of such laws is conveniently lax in a nation that will not even allow girls to be born. Is it any surprise that a 2018 survey showed that India is globally perceived to be the most dangerous country for women? It trumped all other nations on markers such as trafficking as well as cultural and religious practices that include female infanticide, foeticide and child marriage (female genital mutilation and dowry could also be included here). Such embedded gender biases result in a vicious, never-ending cycle. The likelihood of having to pay dowry and the unwillingness to ‘invest’ in education and healthcare for girls contribute to female foeticide; the resultant imbalance in the sex ratio, in turn, is directly proportional to sexual violence and child marriage. Are slight improvements in individual TFR and IMR counts truly significant when the bigger picture remains overwhelmingly bleak?"

    "The Centre is reported to be considering incremental steps to privatize the Indian railways. It has announced a process to identify private players that would run 109 pairs of trains. The process is expected to be completed by 2023. The decision is based on two considerations. First, liberalization mandates the removal of the public sector from areas of commercial business. The second is the fact that one of the largest organizations in the Indian economy is suffering from a shift of passenger and freight volume to other modes of transportation. Yet, the track cover of the Indian railways is dense; it is among the four largest rail networks in the world. It also remains the lifeline for the mobility of ordinary citizens, both for long and short distance travel. Privatization, in principle, has its positive side in terms of promoting competition, improving operational and cost efficiencies, and enhancing the quality of the customer experience. However, the transition needs to be carried out in a transparent manner and all stakeholders must be taken into confidence. It must remain immune from political meddling. If privatization leads to a new monopoly run by the cronies of the powers that be, the entire aim of improving resource-use efficiency would be lost.",
    "One way of ensuring efficiency would be to have different operators owning and managing seamlessly different segments of the railways, such as rolling stock, tracks, telecommunications, stations and passenger services like catering and cleaning. These operations would dovetail into a coherent entity, which would be supervised by an independent authority. Regulations and milder forms of recommendation would mainly focus on the coordination of operations, quality assurance, maintenance, safety and disputes resolution. If such an organizational structure can be conceived of and put into operation, it would work well only if supervision and regulations are free from the kind of political interference that is common in the public sector. But the private operators will face challenges too. IRCTC trains have a higher cost of travel between Lucknow and Delhi compared to the Shatabdi. Both trains have roughly the same speed. Hence private sector operators have to offer a better experience to passengers than that of government trains to be able to justify higher fares. Finally, since the Indian railways carries more passengers on sleeper and unreserved coaches than in the more expensive air-conditioned ones, the optimal differential pricing will be difficult to achieve."

Lest the centre ceases to hold irretrievably, let us mobilize the collective to forge a vigorous social compact. Let us stir ourselves into action for national renewal anchored in a refreshing politics that is not dismissive of idealism as a driving force of history. Now is the time to summon leadership befitting the cause, for “it is not in the still calm of life or the repose of a pacific situation, that great characters are formed”."

    "It’s that time of year again for university people… or it should be. In Delhi, the academic year begins in the middle of July, just as the monsoon breaks over the city. With the introduction of the semester system, it’s anachronistic to talk of an academic ‘year’ broken up as the year is into two self-contained parts, each with its own cycle of courses, assignments and terminal exams, but old habits die hard. Having taught for more than 30 years, I’m hardwired to see the end of the summer vacation as a fresh start.",
    "Except that July is here and the familiar cycle is broken. There was no summer vacation; Covid-19 wrecked the last semester midway and from the middle of March students and teachers entered a long period of suspended animation that was neither term-time nor holiday. In this stay-at-home limbo, we had to remind ourselves that we still had courses to complete, assignments to write and correct and examinations to fret about.",
    "Remote, disembodied teaching via Zoom or Google Meet wasn’t that hard to get used to, which made me wonder about my teaching methods in normal times. In my case, lectures were strictly audio because my ‘broadband’ connection couldn’t support video. Also, it was a relief not to have to worry about stubble and general dishevelment early in the morning at eight, which is when I took my first class. I had exchange students from an American university who, like everyone else, had gone home when the university shut down and any later in the morning would have been too late at night for them.",
    "But there were students closer to home who couldn’t log on to online lectures despite sharing the same time zone. I have Kashmiri students who the Indian State had kicked off the internet or confined to 2G connectivity which made even audio-only classes impossible to attend. Jamia has students from all over the country and from all kinds of backgrounds. Some of them had returned to small towns and qasbahs where they lacked the wherewithal to connect, not because they had been excluded like their Kashmiri classmates, but simply because their circumstances didn’t allow it.",
    "Online teaching has been a useful tool in this time of disruption but in the context of the Indian public university it inevitably means an inequality of access that needs urgent attention. Indian universities were built around the idea of lecture-based teaching because this was cheaper than a tutorial-centred system that needed better student-teacher ratios. So, to be cut off from lectures is to be academically marooned. Some teachers tried to get around this by emailing bullet-point lectures to students with poor connectivity. This doesn’t, of course, address the problem of discussion, which is what makes a decent lecture more than chalk-and-talk, but it’s better than nothing.",
    "The problem of students not being able to access university or departmental libraries as they normally would during term was partly solved by emailing them PDFs from digital libraries like JSTOR and articles and digital books from other sources. It’s one of the university world’s worst kept secrets that file-sharing websites like Libgen allow students to read academic texts that would otherwise be unaffordable or inaccessible. In this time of Covid with students isolated in their homes, these online archives were even more central to the business of teaching and learning. ",
    "Now that universities have completed this disrupted semester by improvising alternatives to end-semester examinations either by requiring students to submit more tutorial essays or, more daringly, by conducting online open-book tests, the challenge of the next semester presents itself. The traditional July beginning is not going to happen. My university, Jamia Millia Islamia, will begin the new semester in August, but the nature of that opening depends on things beyond any university’s control.",
    "Without regular train and bus services between towns and cities and within them, a university’s student body can’t assemble on campus. Over the years, Jamia’s student intake has become more and more pan-Indian. Some of the most familiar student figures from the remarkable mobilization against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens came from faraway Kerala. In all likelihood, classes for the new semester will commence online and continue online until such time as it is safe to travel and live in hostels.",

There is, of course, a pathos to that because you grow older but also a kind of exhilaration because it’s hard, unless you’re Scrooge, not to be buoyed up by the slouching, strutting high spirits of the horde all around you.",
    "The contrast between the intense camaraderie that animated Jamia early in the year and the sanitized emptiness created by the novel coronavirus is a reminder that public universities are the most fraternal institutions in the country. Unlike schools, which are wholly segregated by class and income, a university like the one I teach in hosts real diversity. It is a diversity of young adults learning to get along with their peers on reasonably level terms.",
    "To hear young women shout with laughter at a shady joke, to watch pinky-entwined young men from distant corners of the country walk into a library together, is to witness the socialization of young desis. It’s what good universities do; they try to conjure up a safe approximation of our world and set young people free in it for a few years. (Or they did up until the time the Indian State declared war on them.) But diversity needs proximity and presence to work its magic. It can’t happen on Zoom. We need ",

Science does not merely accept what is perceived by the naked eye but requires verification by instruments. For instance, Galileo relied on the telescope to substantiate his claim to the Church that the sun, and not the earth, is at the centre of the solar system, as claimed by his predecessors like Ptolemy. Science does not accept any ultimate truth. The non-acceptability is applicable even within science where theories are accepted until they are rejected and replaced by alternative theories. This inherent open-mindedness is what distinguishes science from religion, which centres around the idea of ultimate truth. With the progress and increasing legitimacy of various branches of science, religious faith in the West has long been at the receiving end of scientific scepticism. Despite some attempts by religion to reach out to science, the latter has maintained its original stand and stuck to its critical and objective approach. This is the dominant model. I call this the Or-formula, where accepting one is tantamount to rejecting the other. ",
    "However, the Or-formula has been contested by modern Indian thinkers like Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo. They offered, in my reading, an alternative — namely, the And-formula — to define the relationship between science and religion or spiritualism (religion and spiritualism are used interchangeably and at times loosely by them). At first glance, this formula looks either shallow or, at best, a bold attempt. However, on a closer reading of the writings of Vivekananda and Aurobindo, we find two kinds of justification in support of their formula: one, the overlapping, continuity, or commonalities between science and religion; two, the incomplete nature of science.",
    "Vivekananda points out that the Vedas and modern science have some essential things in common. Science, like the teaching of the Vedas, claims that ‘creation is without beginning or end’ and proves that the ‘total of cosmic energy is always the same’. Vivekananda also asserts that there is harmony between the Indian theory of evolution and Western science, dispelling any notion of conflict between the latter and Eastern religions.",
    "However, while the concept of involution was recognized by ancient Indian sages, this had somehow eluded the attention of modern science. This incomplete nature of science can be fulfilled by Indian spiritualism, feels Vivekananda. In this exchange, he envisages that “[s]cience and religion will meet and shake hands”. Reinforcing the need for the West to borrow spiritualism from the East, he says that “The whole of Western civilisation will crumble to pieces in the next fifty years if there is no spiritual foundation.”",
    "Following the same formula, Aurobindo pointedly identifies the limitations of Darwin’s evolutionary theory and claims that Vedanta can help in overcoming these. Similarly, there are limitations within the traditional Indian worldview too. For instance, Indian philosophers neglected the physical world. Their knowledge was ‘confined to a few’, and did not spread to the ‘whole mass of humanity’. The achievements of Indian philosophers and modern science are, therefore, only ‘half achievements’, and they look at the ‘same reality’ from ‘opposite sides’. These two parts ‘will meet from two opposite sides and merge in each other and find in the life of a unified humanity a common world culture.’ In spite of his outright rejection of Hinduism, B.R. Ambedkar’s embracing of Buddhism also indicates his inclination towards the And-formula. Although in his case, it is liberalism and Buddhism.",
    "Having identified these two formulas, let us draw up a sociological description by exploring the role they play in people’s lives. This will help provide a better picture of modern society. The Or-model as we know is predominant in the modern West. This is evident in the response of the renowned mathematician and physicist, James Clerk Maxwell, to the Victoria Institute, which sought to establish a common ground between Christianity and science. In spite of growing up in a religious family, Maxwell wrote, “… I think that the results which each man arrives at in his attempts to harmonise his science with his Christianity ought not to be regarded as having any significance except to the man himself, and to him only for a time, and should not receive the stamp of society.” One can thus see the domain of religion receding fast, for instance, to the limited domain of ‘man himself’ with the growing legitimacy of science. Scientists perceived religious beliefs to be embarrassing, as obstacles to scientific progress.",
    "In contrast, we see the prevalence of the And-model in India. Many modern educated Indians, including scientists and engineers, do not find it necessary to reject religion, or hide it from others, nor treat it as faith, personal belief or even family practice. In fact, they do not hesitate to display this ‘And’ character even publicly. While religious beliefs become obstacles to scientific growth in the Or-formula, religious practice in India, especially the routine in daily life, bringing discipline and considerably curtailing the tendency to distract, seems to have actually contributed to the educational and professional growth and achievement of scientists in India. ",
    "The physicist, C.V. Raman, and Srinivasa Ramanujan, mathematician ",
    "par excellenc",
    "e, found no dichotomy in maintaining their religious beliefs alongside the deeply scientific nature of their work. Ramanujan even claimed a close, direct relationship between his mathematics and the deity, Namagiri, thus posing a serious challenge to the Or-formula. G.H. Hardy is a famous mathematician, a generous mentor of Ramanujan, a radical and hardcore atheist. His relation with Ramanujan brilliantly reveals the tension, professionalism and creativity between two scientists, one atheist, the other a strong and total believer in religion. The And-formula provides a theoretical basis and a better description of modern Indian society.",
    "However, our lives have aspects that belong to the scientific domain and yet lie outside it. At times, they even overlap. Followers of science, surrounded by reductionism, are often handicapped in dealing with those aspects that fall outside its domain. While objectivity and validation form the basis of science, the extent of the scientific domain is limited. Science has no direct explanation for the vagaries of life or human quirks — unexpected suffering or fortune, emotional upheavals, morality or even the aesthetic appreciation of the arts. For instance, at the aesthetic level, our ability to enjoy Rabindranath Tagore’s poetry or Vidushi Kishori Amonkar’s rendering of Raga Bhoopali is not guided by science. The tension between these reminds us of those insightful lines from Tagore — “Alas, a jeweller has come into the flower garden! He wants to appraise the truth of a lotus by rubbing it against his touchstone.” ",
    "Further, in the realm of ordinary life, is it possible for ordinary people to live a life completely devoid of ultimate truths? As the protagonist in Bertolt Brecht’s ",
    "The Life of Galileo",
    " asserts, it is not the job of science “to throw open the door to infinite wisdom but to put a limit to infinite error”. Is it viable to live a life with relative truths? So, areas that lie outside science stare at it, at times grudgingly. ",
    "However, a major limitation of the And-formula is its inability to clearly explain the nature of the conjunction between science and religion. How the two halves are to be related and conjoined. The process of unifying two parts, or shaking hands as proposed by Aurobindo and Vivekananda, respectively, needs detailed discussion. This is necessary given the predominance of this combination in India. Otherwise, there is a danger of the And-formula relapsing into chaos or becoming messy.",

    "Winning the Nobel Prize has been the epitome of intellectual achievement for over a century. Those who win it go to Stockholm to receive it from the king of Sweden (unless they have won the peace prize, which is awarded in Oslo). The ceremony, in my memory (no, I did not go to receive the prize), is unimpressive. The king and courtiers sit on one side in a hall; prizewinners sit on the other side. The name of a prizewinner is announced by a courtier, who also summarizes her — mostly his — achievements. Then the prizewinner walks towards the king, who has meanwhile been given the prize; the king hands over the prize, the prizewinner bows, and goes back to his/her seat. It is nothing compared to the rituals of British monarchy; even a knight kneels before the queen and is lightly tapped with a sword on his shoulder. The best part of the Nobel ceremony is the banquet that follows.",
    "Alfred Nobel’s biography is far more interesting. He manufactured explosives for use in construction. After they killed a number of workers, he invented dynamite, which was much safer. He fell in love with his Austrian secretary, Gräfin (Duchess) Bertha Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau, but she went back to Austria and married someone else. After that he devoted his life to innovation; by the time he died in 1896, when he was just 63, he had 355 patents. To the consternation of his relatives, he left his money to fund prizes for contributors to knowledge. They fought and filed cases; it was 1901 before they could be overcome to set up five prizes — three in the sciences, one for literature, and one for peace, the passion of Bertha.",
    "Nobel Prize winners’ contribution to knowledge is, no doubt, significant according to the experts consulted by Nobel Prize givers; but we do not know what their fellow-scientists — those not consulted — thought of them. The announcement of Nobel Prizes is followed by hagiographic media reports, and some criticism, but it is forgotten in a few days. Whom do scientists think highly of? And how many of them got the Nobel Prize? ",
    "Scientists do not conduct a poll of who amongst them is the best; but an indirect indicator is citations: how often a scientist’s work is referred to by other scientists. Citations were organized for the first time by Eugene Garfield, who was crazy about classification. He collected three degrees — in chemistry, library science and linguistics; in his PhD thesis, he developed an algorithm for converting the names of chemicals into formulas. The problem of organizing citations was first encountered by the legal fraternity; lawyers needed to have a list of all possibly relevant previous cases they might need to refer to in a case. Its solution was created by Frank Shepard, who produced the first list of cases in 1873. The references were printed on stickers, which lawyers could stick in the margins of their case files. Garfield used punch cards normally used in library catalogues, and then started publishing lists. Today it is all computerized, organized and sold for a handsome sum. Citation lists tell us nothing about the content of an article, let alone its quality, but they are the best thing we have.",
    "Amongst the most cited scientists, 11 are physiologists, six chemists, four physicists and three economists. Three of them received the Nobel Prize in 2019: Esther Duflo for economics, John B. Goodenough for chemistry, and Gregg L. Semenza for physiology and medicine. Esther Duflo is well known in India since she is the wife of Abhijit Banerjee. The best introduction to her is what she said about herself once: “What drives me remain simple questions: what makes poor people tick, what keeps them stuck, and how economic policy can help them. This is what helps me get out of bed, even when I am jetlagged and feeling quite sorry for myself.” “She is a quiet person when you meet her,” according to Chiki Sarkar, “but is quick as an arrow.” In her childhood, she read about Marie Curie, who used her Nobel Prize money to buy radium for research (actually, she won two Nobel Prizes, and bought French government’s war loans with the second one). Duflo is a riveting speaker.",
    "John Goodenough is 97 — over twice the age of Duflo. He served in World War II as a meteorologist in the US army. He was awarded the prize for his invention of lithium batteries, which power small devices like shavers and phones. He has all his hair intact on his head. He laughs a lot at his own jokes, even those that are not obvious to others. He thinks dialogue is the key to good research; in other words, research is a communal activity, and involves discussion, both cooperative and competitive.",
    "Gregg Semenza got his doctorate in 1984; since then he has published 405 papers (most of them joint ones) — roughly one a month. He was on the soccer team of Sleepy Hollow High School in New York. He has concentrated on research related to cancer and heart disease; both are leading ailments in the developed world, and attract enormous research and funding.",
    "All three are members of the American academic system, a vast research and teaching industry, which converts its own, government and corporate funds into usable innovations. But there is a difference between Duflo and the two scientists. They have grown up in systems that are older than her; they fitted as cogs in a machine. Duflo initially thought of becoming a historian, and then of joining the French civil service. Then she went to Moscow, did odd jobs as research assistant and thought of a thesis on Russia. She did her first degree in history and economics. Then she went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and did a PhD for which she did a ‘natural experiment’ in Indonesia relating to education and wages. Then she ran into Abhijit Banerjee; together they have done a series of natural experiments related to poverty. ",
    "What I find fascinating about Esther Duflo is that she so often turns to something unexpected. One is never sure what she will take up next in her lectures. It is the same with her research. It is full of surprises. Scientists give dozens of references in their articles; they have to because they are building on the foundations laid by their predecessors and colleagues, and it would be disastrous for them to be seen taking credit for the work of others. Duflo has few references in her papers because there has been little previous work in her line. She is a pioneer. Is she an innovator? Or is economics still an infant science where there is not so much previous research to refer to? Not being addicted to reading academic literature, I cannot give an informed answer. But Duflo has done a great job of studying common people. She should now do another experiment — write for common people. One way to success, according to economists, is to expand the market for one’s products. She should practise what they preach, and turn her economics into fantastic anti-fiction."

    "\nThe first few frames of Season 3 play out almost like a soft reboot of the first season, with Winden — the seemingly sleepy German town that stashes many a secret in its dark bosom, its inhabitants, specifically four interconnected families spanning many generations, having harnessed the potential of radioactive material in the town’s nuclear power station to travel back and forth in time — operating as a mirror universe of what it was in the first two seasons. This is a world without its main protagonist Jonas (Louis Hofmann), and in this universe, it’s his (actually deceased in another timeline and alternate universe, but brought back by deus ex machina) girlfriend Martha (Lisa Vicari), right down to the symbolism of the yellow parka, who becomes the instrument through which much of the initial action plays out.",
    "\n",
    "\nThe players in this Winden universe remain more or less the same, but their equations with each other are not what they quite were, the chess pieces, so to speak, being arranged and rearranged to fit a format in which Jonas doesn’t exist. That sets up the initial intrigue of Season 3 quite compellingly, added to the fact that the apocalypse at the end of Season 2 has forced some of its key members to travel as far back as the late 1800s.",
    "\n",
    "\nWith Season 2 closing out with the idea that some of the Winden folks can now access an alternate universe (“Not when, but in what world”), the new season deliciously builds on its inherent complex narrative, exploring everything from sci-fi tropes and themes to Biblical allusions to philosophical arguments, even as it dizzyingly travels between decades and centuries (1881 to 2053), throwing up the idea of different worlds, alternate dimensions and two warring factions pulling out all the stops to keep their own worlds from hurtling towards an impending apocalypse.",
    "\n",
    "\nCan the dead and the alive exist at the same time? Can two different realities coexist? Can different versions of the same person live in different timelines, their actions and reactions in the past informing their present and their future? Can an infinite chain of cause and effect lead everyone in both worlds to relive the same fate over and over again?  Is every death a new beginning? In Season 3, ",

    "\nThe season builds on its initial premise of ‘The beginning is the end and the end is the beginning’ and ‘Everything repeats itself’, alluding to phenomena and paradoxes like Quantum Entanglement, God Particle, Infinite Loop and Schrodinger’s Cat. Not to mention the chain of Bootstrap Paradoxes that runs through the whole DNA of the show, and finally fulminates this season.",

That comes courtesy Jonas and Martha, who are at the front and centre of the action here. The two are “the glitch in the matrix”, as they discover and then set out to make things right, their love for each other standing strong, and heart-wrenchingly translating into that beautiful scene where they walk the bridge separately into a starry void and see childhood versions of each other, before they are wiped out of existence.",

About the visual style, this was a very conscious decision taken with Soumikda (DoP Soumik Haldar) and Tanmoyda (production designer Tanmoy Chakraborty) after discussions over a very long time. Even the decision of camera movements was taken keeping in mind the death as the central point. You see an entirely different style of cinematography before and after death.",

It’s a very linear narrative with strange non-linear montages chipped in between, which makes it so interesting. In every moment you see in the film, acting to editing, nobody tried to prove a point. Everybody, probably unknowingly, worked along with each other.",

    "\nI am still discovering him. Honestly, I never realised in the shoot how great he was because he was doing everything with so much ease and so naturally, it did not hit me back then. I was just too happy to take every shot as it came naturally. I was more drowned in making the film as a whole than look at him singularly. It was much later when I had completed the film that I realised what a performance he had given! It’s very tough to judge your work until you get a third-person view.",

    "\nI was enjoying myself while writing the screenplay. I can never be a great story writer. For me, cinema is rather a collection of a few ordinary and extraordinary moments. That’s it. I started with a very thin idea and kept on developing every scene consecutively. So nothing you saw in the film is anything I was aiming for. I had completed writing the first half when a song (Barsan lagi badariya) hit me. I immediately rejected the entire script. The moments changed… the story changed… the characters changed! So you see, all these just happened. I believe good things happen like this. It has happened before. I hope it just happens like this forever.",

I wrote everything separately — the death, the childless couple, and the birth. This completed a cycle. But that’s not anything I ever wanted to put across in bold underlining.

I started with just one incident but the other one gradually came in very slowly and I never knew it was so strongly present in my subconscious. I still wish we learned to seize the day.

Bumbada was perfectly ready and so was Poonam (Poonam Gurung). I still remember the dialogue delivery of both the actors was so low that I could actually see that mood reflect on my team! The entire unit was whispering instructions to each other on the floor even after we had cut a shot! The vibe you see in the scene was right there on the floor.

We have Michael Emerson who’s stirring things up. We all are trying to approach these problems that we’re facing that are criminal based. What is it? Is it something that is a demonic possession, or is it just science? And we’re trying to explain it week to week.",

But that’s the story at the centre and I think it’s interesting. I think that they also balance each other out by their approach to this world. I think that’s going to be something that pulls people in, the relationships between the characters, but also it has this element of not being able to look away because you have these things that happen, and horror and disgust and just shock. I think people are drawn to things that frighten them.",

So what leads a guy like him to become a priest in training? Well, he’s obviously got some some skeletons in the closet. It’s something that he’s chosen to do with his life, it’s a big commitment. I think he’s a person who’s very open to the idea that he doesn’t know everything. His sense of emotional intelligence is very high, that’s why he surrounds himself with people who are experts in their fields, so he can find the truth, which is what he really wants more than anything.",

They sometimes say they’re possessed, there was some sort of supernatural influence. There’s something that you hear sometimes, ‘God spoke to me, some so-and-so made me do it, I heard voices’. David comes in and he’s actually someone who actually believes, somehow, that this is possible because he does feel like there is a part of the universe that we can’t explain. And so, in that, he sort of comes in and sort of has his own take on it, but he’s not unaware of the science of it all. So that’s where Kristen comes in.",

    "\n",
    "Will faith and religion play a role in the show’s exploration of evil?",
    "I think faith will play a role because I think when you have people, the audience members specifically, whose faith sort of dictates everything in their life, they approach everything from a place of faith. I think my character having that background and entertaining that as a path for himself, it gives people the idea that everything is not explained through science and there are phenomena that we can’t quite figure out. My character talks about [phenomena] not being repeatable because it’s not something that’s happened more than once, or they can’t study it, there’s just so few examples of it. Why did it happen? What caused it? People will quickly explain it with faith. You know, this is something that’s happened because it’s like a miracle. And those things are things that people respond to.

It was a tough deadline in any case, and we were wondering how to make it happen. But in a couple of days, reality started dawning on us. We didn’t know how we were going to do the entire post-production in a lockdown situation. In a way, editing is easier... it’s a person sitting with a computer, but it involves so many people’s opinions. Anything becomes 5x times more difficult when you have to watch a buffering video, a live edit... what would possibly take a minute when you are in the same room with the editor, took five hours when we were trying to do it virtually or over the phone.",
    "I also had to be cognisant of the fact that everyone was fighting a battle which may have been tougher than mine. But as a team, we had a long chat and we mulled over two options. Either we do this or we don’t. We decided to try doing it. It meant reinventing whatever we knew about post-production, all of us went out of our comfort zones. We didn’t have a mixing room for the sound, we didn’t have a grading room, we wondered how the dubs would happen.",
    "\nBut necessity is the mother of invention. Actors used their phones as microphones, we sent them some high-end software to install, we asked them to pick the quietest corner of their house, they would dub and we would listen and give them instructions over a Skype call, the sound engineer would link in from somewhere, so would I and the dubbing coordinator... it was sheer madness. Namit Das (who plays Jawahar) had to dub his lines after 2am because that’s when a dog in his lane would stop barking after the whole day! (Laughs) And most of our actors were in different corners of the world... Ankur Bhatia (who plays Sangram) was in New York, Vishwajeet Pradhan (Sampath) was in Australia, Jayant Kripalani (Zorawar) was in Calcutta, Sohaila Kapur (Rajeshwari) in Delhi, Priyasha Bhardwaj (Soundarya) in Assam!",
    "\nBut now that it’s worked out, we look back and say, ‘Okay, we can see some of the flaws, but overall, it’s been a satisfying experience’. Especially when we see that these tough times created a piece of art called Aarya. We’ve learnt some wondrous things on this journey. After film school, this has been my biggest learning.",

We were just trying to put a value system out and we were very conscious of the choices we were making in terms of what to show on screen. Families watching together as a result of those choices was the best thing for us. I read a tweet yesterday where someone said they watched the kissing scenes on the show with their parents... they fitted in so well with the context of the larger show that they didn’t feel uncomfortable watching it. OTT is a platform that allows you to express, but we didn’t want to misuse that freedom. We just showed only what served the story.",

    "Also, I was very proud of that ACP Khan (played by Vikas Kumar) track. The LGBTQ angle is very subtly and sensitively put in, and people are reacting to how well we managed to pull off the scene at the cop station when his boyfriend comes to meet him there. We presented it like any other scene where a wife brings a husband his lunch dabba at work. That was the sbrief for everyone present in that scene. It’s a scene that has very few words, but for me, it’s a torchbearer for where I want the world to be. That it was pointed out to me after the show dropped really reaffirmed my faith that the audience does catch the nuances one puts in, more often than not. We tried to put in a lot of things from life into the show.",

The show, at the core, really explores how the death of the father (Tej, played by Chandrachur Singh) turns the family upside down. The only thing that me and the writers, Sandeep Shrivastava and Anu Singh Choudhary, can take credit for is fleshing out the Veer-Pallavi track from what it was in I. We wanted to use Pallavi’s (Gargi Sawant) track to show Veer’s (Viren Vazirani) coming-of-age, who is technically trying to be the man of the house and becomes his mother’s ally in a way. Adi (Pratyaksh Panwar) played a big role in unmasking the killer eventually and Aru (Virti Vaghani) also had an interesting arc.",

    "Igor Stimac, India national football team head coach, has always advocated  more domestic players in the Indian Super League and the I-League.",

    "Stimac feels the new foreign policy in Indian football, at least in the I-League, will allow competition amongst domestic players, particularly in the striking zone.",
    " “The new foreign policy should help us develop more competition in striking positions and, hopefully, in the next four years, we are going to witness new goal-scorers come up,” Stimac told The Telegraph from Split, Croatia.",
    "Lack of quality strikers, other than Sunil Chhetri, is something which has hurt the Indian national team in the recent past. At 35, Chhetri, all-time highest scorer for India, is not getting younger and India have to find somebody who can carry on the job when the captain decides to hang up his boots.",
    "Stimac however said Chhetri is still in great shape and stays motivated as well. “Football is not about age. Either you can, or you can’t. We are well aware that our captain is not getting younger, but he is still in great shape and is motivated to keep going,” Stimac, the man who was a vital cog in the Croatian wheel during the 1998 World Cup, said.",
    "He, however, agreed that the national team is yet to maintain the same tempo when key players miss matches. For example, India struggled against Bangladesh in the World Cup qualifier played on October 15 last year at the Salt Lake Stadium. Sandesh Jhingan, the dependable defender, suffered a knee injury in the build-up to that match and was ruled out for rest of the season.",
    "Trailing 0-1, India had to ride Adil Khan’s late equaliser to log one point from a match which everyone thought would be a cakewalk for the hosts.",
    "“We are still not a side which can keep up the level of the game when playing without a few key players. Losing Sandesh and (Rowllin) Borges before the Bangladesh game was a terrible loss and it affected our stability and shape.”",
    "Stimac though insisted that there would not be any change in approach going forward. “Our process keeps going on in the same direction.”",
    "India’s 0-1 loss to Oman on November 19 was the last match the national team played and, due to the pandemic, the World Cup qualifying matches scheduled in March and June got postponed.",
    "India will now play their remaining three matches in October (versus Qatar at home on October 7) and November (versus Bangladesh away on November 12 and against Afghanistan at home on November 17). Stimac’s men have played five matches in Group E of the qualifiers, collecting three points so far. One point was from holding the reigning Asian Champions Qatar to a goalless draw in September last year.",
    "Stimac, who completed one year at the helm on May 15, said India would have a mountain to climb in the rest of the matches.",
    "“Qatar game is the one we should enjoy and give ourselves another chance of upsetting the Asian champions. Afghanistan is a must-win game and Bangladesh would be a very difficult away match where mental strength and quality would be tested. But under current circumstances — the Covid19 pandemic situation — there’s no possibility of organising any international friendlies. The Leagues also won’t kick-off either. So the task which we are facing before the qualifiers is enormous.”"

    "What would possibly appear surreal to most, is the new “reality” for the West Indies. So says their top-order batsman Shai Hope.",
    "The Ageas Bowl in Southampton on Wednesday would be witness to the return of cricket after the coronavirus-forced break when hosts England take on the West Indies in the opening Test of the three-match series.",
    "Though it would be a step for the game to get back to normality, the surroundings will be far from normal. Playing in a bio-secure environment, including empty stands, will obviously be a different and strange experience for the teams.",
    "Adapting to the changes in the playing environment might be an uphill task, but the West Indies cricketers are not losing sleep over it.",
    "“There were a few changes to get used to when we arrived in the camp last month in Manchester, but I think the team adapted fairly quickly and we were able to have a successful training camp.",
    "“Regarding playing the matches with no fans in the stands, it will certainly take some adjustment. However, every condition you are faced with in cricket has its own challenges and it’s all about adjusting as quickly as possible and being able to express yourself naturally on the field. That’s how we are looking at it,” Hope told ",
    "The Telegraph",
    " from Southampton.",
    "“We are concentrating on what we need to do instead of thinking about what’s not in our control. It’s new reality for us. We must find ways to live with it or wait until there’s a vaccine,” he added.",
    "How did he cope with the lockdown and what did he do to stay motivated?",
    "“During the lockdown days at home, I tried to keep myself busy. While reflecting on the positives and keeping the mind fresh, I also used the time to learn new things about myself and in general.",
    "“Our biggest motivators are our close friends and relatives. They keep us motivated all the time, so spending time with them and highlighting the importance of not taking things for granted is equally important. That in itself is also a motivator.”",
    "Hope’s twin centuries in the victorious Headingley Test symbolised the fight the Windies had put up in their previous tour of England in 2017. The world was different then, and this time, England have a new-look pace attack as well. They look sharper with Jofra Archer in the team.",
    "Hope, however, remains confident, because of the time he spent honing his skills at St Bede’s — a school in East Sussex. That practice has given him a fair idea of how to deal with English conditions. Besides, the latest ICC guidelines banning the application of saliva on the ball could make matters easier, Hope feels.",
    "“No saliva on the ball is something we’ll all have to get used to. But if that means minimal swing to cope with, then that’s one less headache,” he stated.",
    "“Playing England in England is always a tough task, but we’ve been looking forward to the series for quite some time now. We won at home the last time we played them (in early 2019), so we’re expecting them to come even harder at us and that’s the beauty of the game,” Hope added.",
    "As for tackling fellow Barbadian Archer and the rest of the England quicks, Hope seems unfazed.",
    "“He (Archer) is a quality bowler and has done quite well so far in his career. But at the end of the day, cricket is played on the day and I will play each ball on merit,” he said."

    "The JV had a good year clocking 21 per cent growth, backed by rapid expansion and in-store performance. It added 39 new stores during the year, taking the current count to 185 across 11 cities in India. However, only 50 per cent of them are operational now.",

The Tata Digital platform will be available later this year. TCPL has been very focused only on tea and coffee for a very long time. We have taken a conscious call to create a broader company with food and beverages now. Our immediate focus would be to strengthen distribution and make the products available both online and in physical stores,” the chairman assured."

    "The CPM has condemned the move to amend the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, and several organisations of the disabled have urged the government not to go through with the changes, aimed at decriminalising lesser offences to “revive the economic growth and improve the justice system”.",
    "“This step will further erode the legal protections that disabled people have,” National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled (NPRD) general secretary Muralidharan told ",
    "The Telegraph",
    ".",
    "Sections 89, 92(a) and 93 of the act are among those covered by the proposed amendments, now on the website of the Centre’s department of empowerment of persons with disabilities.",
    "These, respectively, criminalise violating the act in general, insulting or intimidating the disabled in public view, and failing to produce information required by the act. The first and third offences are punishable with fines, while the maximum sentence for the second is six months’ jail.",
    "The government has proposed a new Section 95A that will allow offences under these three sections to “be compounded” by the chief commissioner or state commissioner for persons with disabilities “with the consent of the aggrieved person with disability”.",
    "Compounding means the accused and the complainant can enter into a compromise to have the charges dropped against a consideration. The compounding under Section 95A will be “by such amount and in such manner as the central government may, by notification, specify in this behalf”.",
    "The CPM politburo said on Monday: “The ridiculous plea taken by the government that such provisions ‘act as deterrents... (to) domestic and foreign investors’, is unacceptable. ‘Ease of doing business’ cannot be at the cost of basic human rights, won after long-drawn struggles.”",
    "The Centre has sought suggestions on the proposed changes by July 10.",
    "The covering note for the proposed changes says: “The risk of imprisonment for actions or omissions that aren't necessarily fraudulent or the outcome of mala fide intent is a big hurdle (to) attracting investments.”",
    "It adds: “The ensuing uncertainty in legal processes and the time taken for resolution in the courts hurts ease of doing business. Criminal penalties including imprisonment for minor offences act as deterrents, and this is perceived as one of the major reasons impacting business sentiment and hindering investments both from domestic and foreign investors.",
    "A state disability commissioner told this newspaper: “Changes to the law would open up avenues for companies to arrive at settlements with people like disabled employees who complain against them.”",
    "The National Alliance of People’s Movements said: “Diluting these penalties is akin to legitimising offensive behaviour against persons with disabilities and making public and work spaces more unsafe and inaccessible for them.”",
    "Last week, a statement by more than 100 organisations and disabilities rights activists said: “Under the plea of decriminalising ‘minor offences’ the government is proposing to drastically alter the very nature of the RPD Act. The proposed amendments remove even the little teeth that the act contains to ensure its compliance.”"

    "Officials maintained that a child from the nearby Salepur block, about 20 km from Cuttack, was brought for treatment to the OPD last Friday. The swab of the child was sent for Covid-19 test and it turned out to be positive.",
    "“As soon as the report came, we decided to close down the OPD. Disinfection process is going on. All care will be taken to stop the spread of corona cases,” said Satpathy.",

After his Covid test was done and it was found negative, he was shifted to the SCB Medical College. But no doctor came to see my child.",
    "“As his condition worsened, I shifted him on Saturday to a private medical college and hospital in Bhubaneswar,” said 29-year-old Jayshree Samal, whose husband, a migrant worker, returned from Delhi following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.",
    "Samal said: “Here in the private hospital, one needs to bear the cost of the personal protective equipment (PPE) used by the staff of the hospital for treatment of the child. The treatment is costly in the private sector. But I have no option left.”",
    "While patients continue to suffer, corona positive cases are being reported from hospitals as well.",
    "More than 100 corona positive cases have so far been detected from the Acharya Harihar Cancer Centre (ARHCC), Cuttack, and nearly 30 cases have been found in the SCB Medical College and Hospital Cuttack.  Though the OPD of the Cancer Centre has re-opened, patients are yet to turn up for treatment fearing infection.",
    "In view of the pandemic situation, Cuttack collector Bhabani Shankar Chayani on Monday urged people not to visit the collectorate for submission of their grievances and said they can file their complaints online.",
    "As many as 190 positive cases have been found in Cuttack alone. The city is in shut down mode till July 8 midnight.",
    "So far, Odisha has registered 9,526 Covid-19 cases with 38 deaths.",
    "Health secretary P.K. Mohapatra told The Telegraph, “We have asked the medical authorities to follow the SOP strictly and any lapses will cost us dearly. We have decided to carry out an antigen test of persons with suspected Covid-19 symptoms. The antigen test results will be available within two to three hours.”",
    "Sources said the test will be undertaken at the SCB Medical College, ARHCC and Sishu Bhavan in the first phase.",
    "The antigen detection test yields results quickly and they are often used for a first laboratory investigation in a suspected case.",
    "In a related development, the Directorate of Medical Education and Training has asked the AIIMS, Bhubaneswar to admit coronavirus  positive patients for treatment."

With parliamentary elections due for Kuwait’s unicameral legislature in November, the anti-expatriate rhetoric has gained currency in recent months — particularly in the wake of the pandemic — and the new law is expected to be implemented soon as Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al Khalid Al Sabah had in June itself announced the cutback in expats.",

    "“The possibility of not holding exams was discussed. But it would have left a blot on the careers of the batch passing out in 2020. In their interest, it was decided to hold the exams,” the commission official said.",
    "“Performance in examinations gives confidence and satisfaction to the students and is a reflection of competence, performance and credibility that is necessary for global acceptability,” the commission’s revised guidelines say.",

    "Sat Bhavna, a third-year DU Hindi honours student, said she had to climb onto the roof of her home to access the Internet from her mobile.",
    "“I cannot access the question papers or upload the answers from my mobile phone. I cannot take the exams. Most of the time there is no Internet service on my phone,” Bhavna said from her village near Faridabad in Haryana.",
    "Utkarsh Singh, another third-year DU Hindi honours student, who lives in Anglia village near Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh, echoed her.",
    "“There have been no online classes in the last semester, nor have we received any study material. Electricity fluctuation is an everyday problem. This OBE will damage our career,” he said.",
    "Abha Dev Habib, former DU executive council member, opposed the OBE. “The majority of students in the universities, including Delhi University, are from poor families who have no access to computers or laptops,” she said.",
    "“They are currently in their villages. They will miss out on the online open-book examinations being pushed by DU. This means those who ha-ve gadgets will get degrees and those who have not will have to stay back (in their classes). This is discriminatory.”",
    "She said the students and the teachers were expecting relief from exams in view of the Covid-19 outbreak and Pokhriyal’s appeal. “This (commission decision) means the government does not bother about the health and well-being of the students. They want to push online examinations on the pretext of Covid-19,” Habib said.",
    "As for the “special” exams for students who miss out in September, DU executive member Rajesh Jha said holding tests in different months meant assessing the same batch by two yardsticks, which “compromises the sanctity of the exam”. Besides, he said, online exams like the OBE that the students will take from their homes without any supervision will facilitate large-scale malpractice.",

    "Alarmed at China’s stranglehold over supplies of masks, gowns, test kits and other front-line weapons for battling the coronavirus, countries around the world have set up their own factories to cope with this pandemic and outbreaks of the future.",
    "When the outbreak subsides, those factories may struggle to survive. China has laid the groundwork to dominate the market for protective and medical supplies for years to come.",
    "Factory owners get cheap land, courtesy of the Chinese government. Loans and subsidies are plentiful. Chinese hospitals are often told to buy locally, giving China’s suppliers a vast and captive market.",
    "Once vaccines emerge, demand will plummet. Factories will close. But Chinese companies are likely to have the lowest costs by far and be best positioned for the next global outbreak.",
    "“The Chinese have been successful weaving global personal protection equipment dominance with supply-chain command and control,” said Omar Allam, a former Canadian trade official trying to establish production of in-demand N95 medical respirators in his country.",
    "China’s grip on the market is a testament to its drive to dominate important cogs in the global industrial machine.",
    "For years, China’s leaders have worried that the country depended too much on foreign sources for everything from medical supplies to microchips to airliners. It has used subsidies, economic targets and other government inducements to emerge as a powerhouse in those important industries.",
    "When Chinese leaders grew concerned about pollution and dependence on foreign oil, for example, they helped local makers of solar panels, wind turbines and high-speed rail equipment clobber the competition. They have taken similar steps to dominate industries of the future, like the next generation of wireless data transmission, known as 5G.",
    "The state’s heavy involvement in its economy has led to waste and graft that could slow China’s growth. But the policies have often proved effective in building industries that can withstand losses and tough foreign competition. Medical supplies may be similar.",
    "“There will be massive consolidation after the epidemic,” said Howard Yu, a professor of management and innovation at the Institute for Management Development, a business school in Switzerland. “It will be exactly the same dynamics as in green energy, 5G and high-speed rail.”",
    "Before the pandemic, China already exported more respirators, surgical masks, medical goggles and protective garments than the rest of the world combined, the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated.",
    "Beijing’s coronavirus response has only added to that dominance. It increased mask production nearly 12-fold in February alone. It can now make 150 tons per day of the specialised fabric used for masks, said Bob McIlvaine, who runs a namesake research and consulting firm in Northfield, Illinois. That is five times what China could make before the outbreak, and 15 times the output of US companies even after they ramped up production this spring.",
    "American companies have been reluctant to make big investments in fabric manufacturing because they worry that mask demand will be temporary. But Texas required on Thursday that most residents wear masks in public places, part of a broader embrace of face masks in recent days.",
    "“It is a huge mistake to assume that the market will disappear,” McIlvaine said.",
    "Ma Zhaoxu, vice-minister of foreign affairs, said that from March to May, China exported 70.6 billion masks. The entire world produced about 20 billion all of last year, with China accounting for half.",
    "Other countries now want self-reliance. Earlier in the pandemic, China sometimes decided which countries received crucial supplies and demanded profuse and public thanks in exchange.",
    "President Emmanuel Macron of France pledged in March to produce homegrown masks and respirators by the end of this year. Peter Navarro, President Trump’s industrial policy adviser, has begun a push for the federal government to buy American-made pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.",
    "China, however, has a head start.",

    "While it would be too early to rue the death of the cafe culture and we are oh-so-craving those long adda sessions over hot cuppas at our fave brew spots, we could safely say that it is under serious threat, thanks to the virulent virus that rages on.",
    "Friendships and new love brewing over a hot cup to WFC (working from cafe!) over endless cups of your favourite brew, and those out-of-office meetings with colleagues... cafes mean much more than just coffee and nibbles. More so, for the millennials. The coffee, of course, helps seal the deal. Be it espresso, latte or cold brew made from single origin coffee or coffee blends, coffee can brighten up a gloomy day. A survey conducted by the Italian coffee roasters brand Lavazza reveals that 60 per cent millennials rely on coffee to keep themselves happy and 69 per cent millennials and",
    "Gen-Z think of coffee as their companion. Coffee is a way of life with cafes enabling the process. Good food and ambience are the bonus.",
    "However, a cafe as we know it, may not be the same in the wake of the pandemic. The thriving and vibrant cafe culture that the city had been witnessing since the last couple of years, is probably going to give way to a new normal at the cafes.",
    "As the lockdown restrictions have slowly started easing, city cafes have started opening doors for takeaways, deliveries and some for dine-in as well. Cafe owners are rethinking their approach and redesigning their cafe and format to fit the new requirements and ensure safety of the staff and customers.",
    "What's brewing? ",
    "Exactly a year since its entry into the city after having made its mark in Hyderabad, Roastery Coffee House (RCH) is all guns out in its ‘survival mode’. “We opened our outlets for delivery in Hyderabad and Calcutta on May 1 and 19 respectively. We then opened our Calcutta outlet for dine-in on June 8. Even though it probably isn’t worth opening because the sales are very low — 10 to 15 per cent, with whatever money we are earning the burn rate is going down. In Calcutta, the market has been unresponsive. Anyway, this year is about basic survival and health,” said Nishant Sinha, founder of Roastery Coffee House.",
    "Urvika Kanoi of The Daily cafe, on the other hand, doesn’t see dine-in as an option yet. “To me, it makes no sense to open (for dine-in) right now. The paranoia is very real and until the fear settles down, I am going to wait it out,” said the chef-owner. The Daily, which completes one year next month, is going to celebrate with new launches like a new section called The Daily Pantry. “Ideally, we would have wanted to celebrate with our customers but since we can’t, we decided to do these. The pantry has something absolutely new — marinated meat sealed safely inside a vacuum package. I also decided to bring some signatures back that people were really wanting to eat,” said Urvika who turned her south Calcutta cafe into a quarantine zone for her staff, with chairs and tables making way for folding beds.",
    "Sienna Store & Cafe, which has been a melting pot for adda, food and creativity, shut shop even before the lockdown was announced. It then started its delivery service with a handful of employees. The cafe’s focus now lies on a limited delivery and takeaway-only menu with its signature dishes. “Our challenge will be to keep contactless interactions and relationships with those customers who we used to exchange friendly chats and bear hugs with almost every day,” said Shuli Ghosh, co-founder of Sienna Store & Cafe. The inability to smile at guests due to the rigour of wearing masks and face shields, is also a reason of concern for Potboiler Coffee House’s Sonali Lakhotia. “We are always known for our warm service but now, even if we are smiling you won’t be able to see it. So, that warmth will be missing,” said the proprietor.",
    "Potboiler opened doors for delivery and takeaway on June 15 and plans to start its dine-in operations by June-end. Sienna, however, isn’t going to offer its dine-in service yet. “We have to downsize our big dreams and reimagine Sienna in this new context. We do not want to reach a place where we have to consider closing shop,” said Shuli.",
    "Two-and-a-half-year-old Artsy — Coffee & Culture’s founders have come up with a plan that fits the new requirements and includes a drive-by facility where guests can choose to sit in the comfort of their cars. “While delivery of food seems to be an obvious tangent, it isn’t why we put our blood, sweat and tears into building our brand. A cafe with a unique experience like ours can’t be sustained as a cloud kitchen only,” said co-proprietor of the cafe, Manjyot Kaur, who like the others in her industry, fears losing the business altogether.",
    "Some are testing waters at the moment and taking each step cautiously. “Our cafe can accommodate 19 people but sadly we can only have about four to five people at a time now. I want to see how it goes for a month. But right now it’s looking better,” said Sneha Singhi, the chef-owner of Paris Cafe, which is currently operating out of its Ballygunge outlet, while the other two remain shut.",
    "Franziska Oppel of Patisserie by Franziska has started an independent transportation system to ensure that their delicate, temperature-sensitive pastries and cakes get delivered with utmost care. “Initially, we tried several delivery options but it became clear that we would have to do our own delivery and couldn’t rely on third-party delivery services if we wanted to maintain our quality,” said Franziska.",
    "Considered to be one of the pioneers of the third wave coffee movement in India with multiple outlets in various cities, Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters has come up with an app for easing out the process of delivery and pick-ups. “We have changed all our cafes to a self-service model to promote contactless service as much as we can. We have developed a Blue Tokai pre-ordering app which makes it convenient for a customer to place and pick up orders in a contactless, speedy manner whether they are taking away or dining in,” said co-founder Shivam Shahi, who thinks that the “new normal” is already here with major changes in the cafe culture. “I think the biggest challenges that we see lying ahead has to do with the uncertainty. Since the lockdown has been lifted, we have started opening more cafes and dine in-services but we’re already starting to see some cities go back to lockdown. This pattern is something we expect to see more of,” said Shivam. Blue Tokai fans in Calcutta will have to wait for their turn as they are yet to start operations fully here. “We are currently working on restarting our dine-in at our Calcutta cafe next week,” added Shivam.",
    "A little sliver of sunshine",
    "Some in the business are counting their blessings for being able to bring a little bit of cheer to people’s lives. Just like the five-year-old, always buzzing 8th Day Cafe & Bakery. “I think reopening 8th Day (Cafe & Bakery) has been able to bring folks a sense of hope and a slow return to normalcy. As an entrepreneur, I am always thinking about my staff, guests, and greater community first and foremost. I believe this is the heart and soul of entrepreneurship,” said the founder-owner of the cafe, Grant Walsh, who is currently in the United States with his family. For a business that considers itself being driven by values and a sense of community, 8th Day Cafe & Bakery believes in staying true to its essence and being positive in its approach. “Bringing the best coffee, American food, and exceptional service — all embedded in love — remains our foundation and core. You can tinker with things, but never forget who you are,” added Grant.",
    "Sharing Grant’s sense of positivity is Rajesh Singh of Flurys. “Guests availing dine-in service has reduced compared to pre-Covid times. However, with every passing day the number of guests visiting Flurys, Park Street, and other outlets as well, has only been increasing steadily. That’s very promising indeed! We started getting guests for breakfast from Day 1 since we resumed operations,” said the director of the iconic brand.",
    "What happens to the adda & co-working?",
    "The post-pandemic world is certainly going to be full of uncertainties and this isn’t going to be particularly easy for home-grown brands. “The traditional idea of ‘adda’ in Calcutta is being challenged right now and businesses like ours will not be as busy as they were before the pandemic. Lazing peacefully in a cafe is a distant dream at the moment. Do you really want to go to your favourite neighbourhood cafe, practically suffocated with masks, gloves, face shields and the like, eat in isolation, with dividers between you and the family next to you? Sounds like a kind of dismal dystopia that so many will find uncomfortable and scary. This new normal is dismal and will change how Calcuttans interact with each other considerably,” said Shuli.",
    "While most cafe-goers are hopeful that they will be back to their favourite spots sooner or later, they are aware that it may not be the same again. “I have always loved the cafe culture. Sienna and 8th Day (Cafe & Bakery) are some of my faves in the city. I have spent hours alone, reading or writing in Sienna,” said model Ushoshi Sengupta, who is never going to take a cup of coffee with a friend for granted again! If Ushoshi loved her “quiet between the chaos” in cafes, for Priyanka Rati Pal, it was the ambience and a good old cold brew. “I love the ambience at Roastery (Coffee House). It’s so peaceful there. Last year, I visited the cafe almost every week,” said the actress.",
    "Cafes never fit in a single box. They weren’t just about the coffee or spending leisure time only. They also served as co-working spaces where people worked out of, often equipped with Wi-Fi and charging points. City-based photographer Kasturi Mukherjee who doesn’t have her own office, prefers working out of cafes. “Since I don’t have a home-office yet, I often prefer meeting clients/models at cafes. These are open spaces with food and music. We can socialise and have a work meeting simultaneously. Now everything is done over a Zoom call. I definitely miss doing all of that,” said Kasturi. Echoing Kasturi’s words was a millennial coffee-lover. “The cafe culture has become an integral part of my life whether I am brainstorming over a tune or just soaking in the vibe that each cafe gives out. I also miss going out on coffee dates,” said Aniket Dutta, drummer in the city-based band ARC Project.",
    "The city cafes are leaving no stones unturned to ensure that they are up and running but they aren’t oblivious to the horrors that come with it. “Would you want to go to a place on a Saturday night where people are serving you in gloves and masks?” asked Urvika. “People’s visits now will be way more timed. People will prefer working out of home now and not cafes, which had become really popular. We are trying to bring us to you than you to come to us. That’s the new normal,” said Urvika.",
    "The near future seems bleak but some say it’s too early to have the answers yet. “What the virus has done is that it has created a fear and this fear isn’t going away anytime soon. The cafe culture is not going to be the same but I don’t have the right answer yet,” said Nishant who is finding hope and optimism in the growing home-brewing segment. Some like Manjyot are holding on to hope. “We would hopefully like to go back to the pre-Covid culture, as it was hard-earned and well deserved. Calcutta’s coffee culture has been the result of many cafes really putting their heart and soul into every cup. I hope the new normal is hygienic and cautious but with a cup of coffee in hand,” said the ever-smiling Manjyot."

    "This is what he said: “No one here does only one job. That’s why you do not see any slums or poverty. We’re a hard-working people.” That was Suresh Bhaskar, a tourist guide in Wayanad in northeast Kerala. This was some time before the coronavirus crash-landed in the state. What followed thereafter showed the rest of the country the Kerala template, but that’s a story all too well known now. ",
    "Suresh’s story came to be told as he chaperoned his little tour group through hilly terrains and mud tracks cutting across farmlands. Those exact words were uttered as the 44-year-old ushered everyone into a villager’s house in Kavumannam for a taste of their traditional vegetarian lunch. He helped the host, Kuttayi, serve, and also continued with his commentary on each dish. Suresh said of Kuttayi, a man in his thirties dressed in a blue checked shirt and a kaavi mundu (the local name for a dull saffron lungi), “He is a chef. He hosts tourists too and opens his house as a homestay accommodation.”",
    "The opening words were part of his introduction of Kuttayi, but they could just as well be applied to him — not one to do just one thing.",
    "A farmer’s son, Suresh had set off to attend a poetry camp in Trivandrum (now Thiruvananthapuram) as a teenager. He was one of the 50 selected from across the state. “I had seen the notification in a magazine at the Bodhi Granthalaya in our village. I did not have the means, so the library helped me apply and also sponsored my travel,” recalled Suresh. “The library is long gone,” he added in soft tones. That was the first time he was travelling out of Wayanad and his first unescorted travel. It was his first train journey as well.",
    "In Trivandrum, Suresh was lodged near an art gallery — the Sri Chitra Art Gallery, famous for its Raja Ravi Varma collection. A walk through the gallery opened another world for him. “Back in school I used to draw and had won many competitions too. But I had no idea of the different forms, mediums, schools of art,” he laughed. In any case, the boy who entered the gallery was not the same person who left it that day.",
    "Suresh started dreaming of it as a vocation. The newly learnt names — Raja Ravi Varma, Nicholas Roerich, the Mughal school, the Tanjore school, Chinese, Japanese and Balinese paintings, mural and miniatures — and their images swirled inside his head.",
    "He completed a diploma course in art after he had done his bachelor’s in Malayalam. His parents were not happy with this “distraction”, so he would paint only when he wasn’t helping them on the farm. He would also paint political banners and posters to ease the financial burden. After a couple of years, there came a time when he held his solo exhibition. His work found its way into the portals of the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi too.",
    "By 2007-08, tourism picked up in Wayanad in a big way. Said Suresh, “I thought I might as well make the most of it.”",
    "When one of the members of our tour group, a man from Hyderabad, struggled to explain to his folks back home over the phone where exactly he was, Suresh prompted him in Telugu. It is not surprising to have a tourist guide know a language or two other than his mother tongue. But turned out Suresh also knew Tamil and Kannada, Hindi and English. He said, “I did not pick up the languages as a tour guide. I had started learning them when I began travelling to do freelance commercial artwork and exhibitions.” After a pause he added, “I learnt French at the Alliance Française in Puducherry. When we started getting a lot of foreign tourists, I realised it would help.”",
    "As he traipsed all over Wayanad district shepherding tourists, Suresh did not lose sight of art. In fact, he travelled beyond the canvas. He got into clay-modelling and with such seriousness too that he eventually started to get calls for workshops. And then, in 2018, along with two others, he founded an art gallery.",
    "And so he meanders on, continues to discover new boundaries, true to his own definition of the Kerala template: everyone does everything."

Let’s hope that justice comes swift for the Floyd family and for the nation.” The pandemic, he believes, must be allowed to run its course; for “it’s a forerunner of something else to come… Extreme arrogance can have some disastrous penalties.”",

    "Dylan resurrects Anne Frank, Rolling Stones and Indiana Jones, all in one song. A young girl of unbridled courage, a rock n’ roll band that’s been playing since eternity and a fictional adventure junkie made real by the symphonic sublimity of John Williams music. “Her story means a lot.

Telecommunications and advanced technology is the world they were born into. Our world is already obsolete.”",
    "Does that mean good is obsolete too? While discussing Little Richard, who Dylan says, lit a match under him, he dwells on the power and affirmative intent of gospel music, contrasting it with the world’s obsession with “good-for-nothing news”, a phenomenon he blames today’s media for. “Good news in today’s world is like a fugitive, treated like a hoodlum and put on the run. Castigated. All we see is good-for-nothing news. And we have to thank the media industry for that,” he says.",
    "For the many of us who have spent our insignificant lives following Dylan’s poetry and music, we have obsessed about his many ways. We soaked in his boyish charms as he went about asking questions, the answers to which were blowing in the wind. We bought into his self-perpetuated protest singer myth, heard in his song the stories we wanted to hear. We needed a symbol, and we thought he had allowed us to choose him. When he saw Saint Augustine, in his 1967 album John Wesley Harding, and re-embraced his Christian roots with Slow Train Coming in 1979, many of us sneered at his born-again resurrection. Others derided him for having dared to sully our precious memories of him as the troubadour. But the truth is, Dylan was done leading a life for us.

Guys, we were great; Let’s play louder next time, he would tell Robbie, whose initial befuddlement ultimately gave way to inner belief that what they were doing was indeed great.",
    "Dylan betrays this spark within while describing Robert Johnson, the American blues guitarist whose recordings of the ’30s have influenced generations of musicians. “Robert was one of the most inventive geniuses of all time. But he probably had no audience to speak of. He was so far ahead of his time that we still haven’t caught up with him. His status today couldn’t be any higher. Yet in his day, his songs must have confused people. It just goes to show you that great people follow their own path.”",
    "In these days of long, black clouds coming down, Dylan is content to be able to knock a few fresh punches. Knock-knock? Heaven’s Door is now his signature brand of whiskey launched in 2016, making him one of two Nobel laureates to be personally associated with a spirits brand — Winston Churchill being the other has a Pol Roger champagne to his name. With his album of new songs, Rough and Rowdy Ways, Dylan is painting some more. We’d better not stand too close. Or else, we’ll miss the big picture.",

    "When I Paint My Masterpiece ",
    "is among the timeless ones that, he notes, has grown on him. “I think this song has something to do with the classical world, something that’s out of reach. Someplace you’d like to be beyond your experience. Something that is so supreme and first-rate that you could never come back down from the mountain. That you’ve achieved the unthinkable.”",
    "Will Dylan write a song on the pandemic and its fallout? On people dying, on people losing their jobs, on millions of forgotten people walking miles on end to get home because they’ve suddenly been cast aside? Or may be on the importance of remembering? If he does, it will be another painting with the same colours he’s been using his entire life. Bruce Springsteen likes to think of him as the “father of my country”. At a time when we seem to have forgotten ours, it’s the eternal quest for that masterpiece we’ll need to hold on to."

    "The year is 2000. Vanessa Wye is 15 years old; Jacob Strane, her English teacher at boarding school, is 42. No one in their right minds would call this a love story. And yet, to Vanessa, love is precisely what it is.",
    "Seventeen years later, during the ‘Me Too’ movement, Strane is accused of sexual abuse by another former student. Vanessa, now 32 and still certain that her relationship with Strane was not abusive, is appalled. “All he did was fall in love with me and the world turned him into a monster.”",
    "It is with this devastating insight into the mind of the narrator that Kate Elizabeth Russell begins her remarkable debut novel. The reader sees what Vanessa cannot: that her story with Strane is one of destruction, not love. He is a predator; she is his victim. It is not hard to see why he makes Vanessa feel the way she does. He is a careful groomer who “berates himself to make you feel sorry for him” and, before every inappropriate touch, says, “the last thing I want is to overstep”. At the same time, he tells Vanessa that she’s ‘dark’ and fascinating, that her hair is the colour of maple leaves, that he will not do anything she does not want. He makes her — a lonely girl at school who does not want to pursue boys but is aware that they do not notice her — feel treasured. She finds him physically repulsive, but his attention feels electric: it contradicts her view of herself as unexceptional.",
    "Russell makes the chasm between the narrator and the reader feel unbridgeable: Vanessa is adamant and blinkered, and her account see-saws between sudden flashes of dreadful insight and the robotic spiel of a cult victim. “I was the first student who put the thought in his head”; it is clear that these words are not hers. She learns of the other girls from her school that Strane preyed on; she continues to defend him.",
    "Interestingly, in the first of many micro-escalations of the abuse, Strane gives Vanessa his own copy of ",
    "Lolita",
    ". In ",
    "Lolita",
    ", Vladimir Nabokov lets the child indict Humbert Humbert, her abuser and the narrator. We remember how ",
    "Lolita ",
    "manifested the markers of sustained abuse. But Nabokov also uses language to keep his reader at a distance from the horror of an adult raping a 12-year-old girl. Russell does her reader no such favour; Vanessa’s account of the first time Strane rapes her is deeply distressing to read. The teenaged Vanessa knows what happened but does not know what to do with that realization. The adult Vanessa recalls, with disturbing calm, her recent sexual encounter with Strane, in which she tried to recreate the first time. In a terrifying demonstration of how prolonged abuse can influence the victim’s thinking, Vanessa says, “To be groomed is to be loved and handled like a precious, delicate thing”. Only towards the end does she show signs of acknowledging what the reader has always seen.",
    "In depicting Vanessa’s trauma thus, however, Russell ensures her reader also sees something else: that there is no ‘perfect’ victim, and different people process abuse differently. Russell writes Vanessa from a rarely-considered perspective: that of a victim who wishes to protect her abuser. ",
    "My Dark Vanessa",
    " is a gut-wrenching psychological portrait of the aftermath of abuse, a damning indictment of a society that allows girls to endure such pain, and mandatory reading for its insights. “The excuses we make for [abusive men] are outrageous,” says Vanessa, “but they’re nothing compared with the ones we make for ourselves”."

    "Anti-racism protests are raging across the world, triggered by the street-side killing of George Floyd, an African-American, by policemen in Minneapolis in the US. A protest wave hashtagged BlackLivesMatter has resulted in statues of Confederate leaders all over the US being removed, destroyed or vandalised. In Britain, statues of slave traders and colonialists have been brought down. In Belgium, protesters burnt the statue of colonialist emperor King Leopold II who lorded over the deaths of millions of Africans at the turn of the 20th century. Statue vandalism in times of regime change or political tumult is not new, but such seminal iconoclasm in social protests is probably a first.",
    "Calcutta too witnessed removal of statues 50 years ago, at the time of the Naxalite movement. The targets were figures of bourgeoise political leaders and 19th century social reformers. “Busts of Vidyasagar and Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray at College Square were brought down. Asutosh Mukherjee’s bust at Calcutta University was also broken by Naxalites,” says Sandip Bandyopadhyay, a researcher and historian. Among the others that were targetted were Gandhi, Tagore, Rammohun Roy and Vivekananda. In fact, Naxal leader Charu Mazumdar justified it all saying that the statues belonged to “intellectuals of bourgeois democratic revolution” who diverted common people from the anti-British freedom struggle.",
    "Says Bandyopadhyay, “They didn’t realise that Rammohun and Vidyasagar were no less revolutionaries who fought against age-old superstitions, bigotry and Hindu hegemony. Neither did they explore how Asutosh struggled for autonomy in higher education against the colonial masters.” Years later, Naxalite leader Ashim Chatterjee admitted at a public meeting, “We failed to recognise a revolutionary in Vidyasagar. He was the nerve centre of Indian renaissance, an indigenous struggle.”",
    "Before India’s Independence, 37 statues of Raj icons had been installed in Calcutta — around the Maidan area, Red Road and the banks of the Hooghly. When the Victoria Memorial was built in 1906, a dozen were placed on its premises. The Naxalites did not touch any of these. ",
    "But by the early 1970s, the United Front (UF) government had already started removing these statues out of public sight. According to Bandyopadhyay, the initiative was led by Subodh Banerjee, SUCI leader and PWD minister in the UF government. The minister, however, appreciated the artistic value of these sculptures; he didn’t believe in their destruction. The then governor of Bengal, Dharma Vira, ordered that the statues be installed on the Flagstaff House premises in Barrackpore, with restricted public access.",
    "Of the 37 statues, 13 were rehabilitated in Flagstaff House, the erstwhile  address of the viceroy’s private secretary, and currently the local retreat of the Bengal governor.",
    "Statues of nationalist leaders came up instead. For instance, at the northern gate of the Victoria Memorial, freedom fighter and philosopher Aurobindo replaced the racist viceroy, Lord Curzon. The workmanship on the new statues, however, was no match to the works they had replaced.",
    "Curzon’s statue — crafted by British sculptor Hamo Thornycroft in 1911 — has a proud forehead, an imperious nose and a pointed gaze. In its place, Aurobindo’s statue looks emaciated and forlorn. And ironically too, Curzon had been the driving force behind the protection of India’s architectural heritage and was instrumental in passing the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act of 1904. ",
    "Curzon’s statue had been part of a memorial. It was surrounded by smaller statues or statuettes representing commerce, agriculture and famine relief — supposedly significant achievements of the former viceroy. While the main statue was banished to Flagstaff House, the statuettes remain. Stripped of their original context though, they remain reduced in every sense. ",
    "In Barrackpore, Flagstaff House is referred to by locals as Latbagan or the lord’s garden.  Amidst its verdant groves stand the statues. Viceroys Lord Curzon, John Lawrence, Thomas Baring and the Earl of Northbrook; Edwin Samuel Montagu of Montagu-Chelmsford reforms; and the Earl of Ronaldshay who was the governor-general of Bengal — all are carved in bronze and transplanted from around the Calcutta High Court area. Some of the others, on horseback, are the earls of Mayo and Minto. Captain of the Royal Navy, William Peel, who died shortly after the 1857 uprising, is the lone marble figure.",
    "In front of the Hall of Fame at Flagstaff House is a statue of King George V. It was erected in 1939 with much fanfare and once adorned the crossing of King’s Way (now known as Gostha Paul Sarani) and Strand Road. In Mrinal Sen’s film Interview, there is a scene in which this statue is shown being hauled away by a PWD crane — a reminder of the end of British imperialism in India.",
    "Remarkably, little damage has been done to imperial statues in India, says historian Rosie Llewellyn-Jones in an email interview from London, UK. She has visited Flagstaff House several times. She says, “One statue of Lord Wellesley was beheaded [in Bombay in 1969] and a couple of Queen Victorias lost their hands, but apart from that these, reminders of foreign rule have been well treated. It was sensible to move some of them to Barrackpore, although Queen Victoria remains serene outside her memorial hall. Calcuttans accepted colonial statues as part of a shared heritage.”",
    "In 2006, the then mayor of Calcutta, Bikash Bhattacharya, had revealed plans to rehabilitate the banished statues from Barrackpore to Citizen’s Park adjacent to Victoria Memorial. British architectural historian Philip Davies was consulted for the project. Davies tells The Telegraph via email from London, “I discussed the reinstatement of selected statues on their plinths with the former mayor about 10 years ago, but it came to nothing.” ",
    "Llewellyn-Jones deplores “the sudden trend of demolishing the past”; she calls it “retro-liberalism”. For Davies, the statues are important works of art by leading sculptors of the time. ",
    "Davies, who also chairs the Commonwealth Heritage Forum in Britain, says of the recent events in England, “If campaigners seeking to remove those statutes relating to Britain’s colonial past want a genuine debate around shared heritage, then the answer is not cultural iconoclasm but to retain them in the public domain as focal points to stimulate the very dialogue they crave.”",

    "At the same time, Amse had said the villages would write to the Bangladesh government for construction of the dilapidated road.",

    "He clarified that with regard to the press statement last week, the intention was only “to draw the attention of the government” to the problems of the rural border population which has affected their livelihood. ",
    "“We only wanted to express the problems of the people and wish the government to listen to our grievances. We wish to clarify that the people has no intention or desire to go to Bangladesh and that we affirm our allegiance to the government and Constitution of India,” he said.",
    "“There is no doubt that our people have full allegiance to the government and that our intention should not be construed wrongly as we only seek development for our people. We also wish to thank many NGOs who have raised this issue of road problems and solicit everyone’s support so as to ensure that we get the road project and also other basic needs.”",
    "He also said the people welcome the visit of the district administration and police to the villages as they feel hopeful and connected with the government. ",
    "“We will continue to pursue the matter of road construction with the government in democratic lines and we hope and remain optimistic that the issue will be resolved and that the proposal for road construction will be sanctioned by the Union government,” Suchen said. ",
    "In the weeks to come, he said the villagers will meet chief minister Conrad K. Sangma and deputy chief minister Prestone Tynsong to highlight the problems of the villages which have crippled the life of the people. ",

    "IIT Guwahati has become the first such institute in the country to introduce a course on UN-Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 from the 2020-21 academic year. It intends to “reorient” the thinking of young and dynamic individuals towards “building” a better and inclusive society.",
    "This is a compulsory four-month course for all undergraduate (BTech) students to be offered in the second year. The academic year usually starts in July but this year the date has not been finalised because of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
    "Prof. T.G. Sitharam, director, IIT Guwahati, said there is an urgent need to adopt these 17 SDGs as part of the curriculum. “With only 10 more years remaining to fulfil these objectives, it becomes very vital that the students are taught about the goals of inclusive and sustainable growth and through this course, offered by faculty members from across engineering, science and humanities departments. IIT Guwahati wishes to prepare the students to play leading roles in ‘Transforming the World,” he said.",
    "In 2015, world leaders agreed at the United Nations General Assembly to implement 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) that are meant to transform the world, building upon the principle of “leaving no one behind”. ",
    "These 17 goals aim to create a better world by 2030, by ending poverty, fighting inequality, hunger, addressing issues related to climate change, good health and wellbeing, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation as well as affordable and clean energy.",
    "The other goals include decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; life below water, life on land, peace and justice strong institutions, and partnerships to achieve these goals.",
    "Professor Anamika Barua, course coordinator from the department of humanities and social sciences, IIT Guwahati, revealed that this would be the first time the nine departments of IIT Guwahati have joined hands to offer a course at the undergraduate level. This is based on the realisation that sustainability challenges and inclusive growth go hand-in-hand and have to be understood at the crossroads of science and society through an interdisciplinary lens.",
    "“The students, through this course, would be educated to critically evaluate the idea of sustainability as an emerging discipline and have an opinion on the role for India, as a nation, in the successful implementation of the new SDGs,” she said.",
    "Asked whether any other institution in India or abroad offers this course, Barua said none of the IITs has so far floated such a course. There are 23 IITs in the country.",
    "“In other institutions in India, too, the focus has been on sustainable development where SDGs are a part of it, but in this course, the focus is entirely on SDGs and how can these goals be achieved. What kind of technological, social, and political interventions are needed to achieve these goals. Hence, interdisciplinary lens have been adopted. Abroad, there are some institutions where such courses are taught, but not as a compulsory course,” Barua said.",
    "Professor Vimal Katiyar, involved in designing the course and from the department of chemical engineering, said that with this course, IIT Guwahati intends to nurture budding technocrats through sustainable technological practices to achieve an environmentally benign, safe and inclusive industrial ecosystem and foster innovations for the development of a sustainable society.",
    "Established in 1994, IIT Guwahati is located on the north bank of the Brahmaputra, around 20km from the heart of the city."

    "Following the protests, the state government said there had been no mining since October 2019 and it had imposed a penalty of Rs 48 crore on CIL for mining without approval, Khataniar said. On May 20, Sonowal also directed forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya to visit the site and submit a report.",

    "The Telegraph",
    " on Monday that the reduction of “tax” from five per cent to three per cent  by the group is only for contractors operating in the state. The “tax” will be calculated on the work order, he said. There are over 500 contractors in the state.",
    "The NSCN(I-M)’s announcement assumes significance because it comes amid a row triggered by a letter written by governor R.N. Ravi to chief minister Neiphiu Rio over the “grim” law and order situation in the state on June 16. Without naming anyone, Ravi spoke of law and order problems over “extortion by armed gangs”, which the NSCN (I-M) has taken exception to.",
    "The group, which signed a Framework Agreement with the Centre in August 2015 to end the decades-old Naga political problem, announced its decision to “reduce tax” in a statement issued on Saturday but it did not specify who would benefit from the move or the cycle of payment.",
    "“This is for general information that in the context of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic crisis and the economic slowdown that followed because of the continuing lockdown, the 5% tax payable to the Government of the People’s Republic of Nagalim (GPRN) shall henceforth be reduced to 3% with immediate effect,” the NSCN(IM)’s statement said.",
    "The Dimapur Chamber of Commerce and Industry was among the first to flag the issue of rising extortion during the pandemic. It said",
    "Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) were demanding tax item-wise, making it difficult for the business community to operate. There are seven NNPGs, which joined the peace talks with the Centre in 2017.",
    "The governor’s letter had highlighted the “unrestrained depredations by over half-a-dozen organised armed gangs, brazenly running their respective governments, challenging the legitimacy of the state government without any resistance from the state law and order machinery.” Ravi, who has been an interlocutor in the peace talks, also said the rampant extortion and violence by the armed groups had sparked panic.",
    "He said contractors of the National Highway Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) working on the NH-29 four-lane project, had complained of armed gangs stopping work unless five to seven per cent of the project cost was paid to them as ransom. Those defying or delaying payment were abducted or assaulted, Ravi’s letter said.",
    "On June 27, NSCN (I-M) reacted to Ravi’s letter, which was visible on social media on June 25, by denying extorting money but said it “levied legitimate taxes” on the people.",
    "“Taxes have been the source of sustenance that has brought the Naga political movement this far...legitimately acknowledged by earlier interlocutors and Indian authorities,” the NSCN (I-M) said.",
    "Collection of taxes for the Naga cause is as old as the Naga political issue, sources said. Government staff, vendors, contractors, shopkeepers and property-holders all have to pay to the different groups, including the NSCN(I-M)."

    "The 3.5km-flyover will take off from Metropolitan and enter Salt Lake over the Chingrihata crossing. It will then take a right turn from the Nicco Park crossing to enter Sector V and run about 800m above the East Calcutta Wetlands before entering New Town, said an urban development department official.",
    "“The flyover will end near the Biswa Bangla Gate in New Town,” the official said.",
    "Officials associated with the planning of the project said the flyover’s take-off point on the Bypass would be close to where the northern ramp of the Parama flyover merges with the artery.",
    "“The idea is that anyone coming from central and north Calcutta via Park Circus and from south and southeast Calcutta via Ruby can take this flyover and reach New Town without getting stuck in snarls,” an official of the urban development department said.",
    "Once ready, the flyover will reduce the commute time between southern parts and fringes of the city and the airport. “It will be a straight drive till the Biswa Bangla gate without any signal. What takes about 25 minutes now will be covered by 10 minutes when the flyover is ready,” said another official.",
    "One arm of the flyover will get down near the Nicco Park and another arm in Sector V. “The arm that gets down near Nicco Park will be useful for people heading to parts of Salt Lake other than Sector V. The arm going down in Sector V will benefit those who go to the tech hub for work,” the official said.",
    "“The infrastructure committee of the urban development department has greenlighted the project. It has gone to the finance department for its approval. Once the approval comes, a tender will be floated,” another official of the urban development department said.",
    "“The department has decided to build the flyover in phases. In the first phase, the stretch between Metropolitan and Nicco Park will be built.”",
    "Engineers and officials associated with the project’s planning said a traffic study on the possible rise in the number of vehicles headed towards Sector V in the next few years prompted them to split the project into phases.",
    "“The study shows a leaping jump in the number of vehicles going to Sector V. The bulk of these vehicles will come from Ruby and they will take a right turn from Chingrighata, which is why we want to complete the stretch between Metropolitan and Nicco Park, which serves as the entry to Sector V, in the first phase,” the official said.",
    "The urban development department has forwarded the project proposal to the PWD to run a second check. “Since the PWD is handling big projects such as the Tallah and Taratala flyovers, the proposal has been sent to the department for a second look,” the official said.”",
    "The proposed flyover would also act as a replacement for the existing Chingrighata flyover that would be pulled down. A team of bridge engineers has recommended its demolition. ",
    "The Telegraph ",
    "reported on Monday that the flyover would undergo repairs soon to make it last another five years, during which the new flyover is expected to be ready.",
    "An engineer said the turn or curvature of the proposed flyover would not be as sharp as the existing ones. The team of bridge engineers called the existing bridge’s geometry flawed because of the sharp curve. Heavy vehicles moving at a high speed find it difficult to manoeuvre the curve and hit crash barriers.",
    "“The proposed flyover will have a much safer curve so that heavy vehicles are not barred from using it,” said an engineer.",
    "In October 2019, the urban development department had asked IIT Kharagpur to carry out a survey and draw up a report on how to decongest the Chingrighata intersection of the Bypass. The report is expected to reach the government shortly."
