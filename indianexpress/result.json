    "About two weeks after US Secretary of State Michael R Pompeo made a quiet call to External Affairs minister S Jaishankar after the June-15 Galwan clash, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla met with his American counterpart, Under Secretary of State (Political Affairs) David Hale, Tuesday evening through a video call.",
    "In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said that Foreign Secretary Shringla and Under Secretary Hale exchanged views on a “number of regional and global issues of shared interest” — in a reference to the border stand-off. “They reaffirmed their commitment to work towards ensuring a free, open, inclusive, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” it said, in what can be seen as a clear signal to Beijing.",
    "The two reviewed the entire gamut of engagements under the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, including political, economic, commercial, regional and international cooperation, the MEA statement said.",
    "It also said that they agreed on the need to deepen cooperation in the United Nations, especially during India’s membership of the United Nations Security Council for the period of 2021-2022.",
    "The MEA statement also said that in the backdrop of the ",
    "COVID-19",

    "pandemic",
    ", they agreed to further strengthen the bilateral health partnership, including on pharmaceuticals and vaccine development.",
    "“They discussed ways to further enhance mutually beneficial trade and people-to-people ties, including through visa facilitation for students and professionals,” the statement said, alluding to the recent decision on student visas.",
    "They agreed to remain in touch and move forward on the bilateral agenda through a range of mechanisms like the 2+2 Ministerial that India will host later this year.",
    "While there is some disengagement taking place between the troops of both sides in eastern Ladakh, the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Tuesday that the US military “will continue to stand strong” in a conflict between India and ",
    "China",
    " or anywhere else.",
    "“The message is clear. We’re not going to stand by and let China or anyone else take the reins in terms of being the most powerful, dominant force, whether it”s in that region or over here,” White House Chief of Staff Meadows told Fox News.",
    "“And the message is clear. Our military might stands strong and will continue to stand strong, whether it’s in relationship to a conflict between India and China or anywhere else,” Meadows said in response to a question.",
    "This is in line with the US thinking to counter the growing Chinese military threat perception.",
    "On June 26, Pompeo had said that the US is reviewing its global deployment of forces to ensure that it is “postured appropriately” to counter the growing Chinese military threat to countries like India, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
    "At the virtual Brussels Forum 2020 of the German Marshall Fund, the US Secretary of State had said, “We’re going to make sure we’re postured appropriately to counter the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). We think that the challenge of our times, and we’re going to make sure we have resources in place to do that.”",
    "The force posture review is being done at the direction of President Donald Trump, as part of which the US is reducing the number of its troops in Germany from about 52,000 to 25,000, he said.",
    "Pompeo said that the force posture would be dictated by ground realities. “In certain places there will be fewer American resources. There will be other places – I just talked about the threat from the Chinese Communist Party, so now threats to India, threats to Vietnam, threats to Malaysia, Indonesia, South China Sea challenges, the Philippines,” he said.",
    "Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Pompeo — who has been leading the charge against China from the front after the initial statements from Washington, which were perceived as neutral in nature — said the US is “certainly looking at” banning Chinese social media apps, including TikTok.",
    "“I don’t want to get out in front of the President (Donald Trump), but it’s something we’re looking at,” Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News.",
    "US lawmakers have raised national security concerns over TikTok’s handling of user data, saying they were worried about Chinese laws requiring domestic companies “to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.”",
    "Last week, the White House spokesperson had said that US President Donald Trump believes that China’s “aggressive stance” against India and other countries in the region confirms the “true nature” of the ruling Communist Party of China.",

    "Terming it a diversionary tactic, the CM said that having failed to respond to his persistent and relevant questions on the Galwan Valley issue, the BJP-led Central government was now trying desperately to distract the people with its personal attack on Rahul. Not just Rahul but the entire country wants answers to those questions, which touch upon not just our soldiers but every Indian who wants to know what went wrong in Galwan Valley on June 15, he added.",
    "“Rahul had been discussing the China issue with me for a long time, and had been concerned about the matter even while the Central government was vehemently denying any stand-off in Galwan,“ Amarinder said.",
    "Pointing to the latest statements from Prime Minister Narendra Mondi on no intrusion having taken place in the region, he asked how the Chinese were now backing off without having entered Indian territory in the first place. These are the kind of questions being raised by Rahul, he noted, adding that instead of answering them, the Government of India continues to be in denial even now.",
    "Reacting to Nadda’s criticism of Rahul for not attending a single meeting of the Standing Committee on Defence, Amarinder questioned the relevance of this to the Galwan Valley stand-off. The committee does not take on-ground decisions relating to the battle field, he remarked, adding that it was not the Standing Committee which decided on sending soldiers to the borders with either no or inadequate arms and ammunition. Nor does it make policy decisions on conditions in which the soldiers should or should not open fire, he said.",
    "Even matters that are discussed in these meetings, such as those related to equipment shortage/procurement, just end up getting consigned to the archives, said Captain Amarinder, citing his own experience as a member of the Standing Committee on Defence during his last term as MP.",
    "The CM, himself an ex-Army man, recalled that at one meeting he had attended he had raised the issue of shortage of ammunition, and was told that the problem would be resolved in five years, to which he had quipped “let’s ask Pakistan and China to wait for five years”. Even during ",
    "Kargil war",
    ", India had to purchase ammunition at higher prices from countries like Israel and South Africa, he noted, adding that soldiers are forced to use practice ammunition in combat due to this long-standing ammunition shortage. He termed these meetings simply a forum to “show our faces” with no concrete results emerging from the deliberations.",
    "Contrary to Nadda’s charge of Rahul demoralising the nation and questioning the valour of our armed forces, the Congress MP was actually looking after the interests of the country and our forces, Captain Amarinder said. Apart from the fact that Rahul has the democratic right, like every other Indian, to question the government, the issues raised by him are important for ensuring that we are not caught napping again and do not end up unnecessarily sacrificing the precious lives of our soldiers, as happened in Galwan, he added.",
    "The CM also flayed Nadda’s remarks on `dynastic tradition’, pointing out that Rahul got elected to the Lok Sabha by popular vote, and not due to his family connections. By questioning his credibility as an MP and as an intelligent Indian, the ruling party was only exposing the Central government’s total failure in Galwan, which had cost the nation dearly in terms of precious human lives, he added.",

    "By Smriti Khemka and Anmol Rathore",
    "In his popular lecture series, The School and Society, the American philosopher and education reformer John Dewey says, “the chief difference between savagery and civilisation is not in the naked nature which each faces, but social heredity and social medium”.",
    "The significance of such an understanding cannot be emphasised enough at a time when the ",
    "COVID-19",
    " crisis has posed several challenges to the country’s educational system. Education is often seen as a means to minimise social and economic inequality. However, when social hierarchies and the medium of education itself play critical roles in access to education, it is unlikely to achieve its noble targets. COVID-19 has brought about disruptive changes in the way education is imparted in schools across the world — many countries have resorted to online and technological interventions. But in India, such interventions can result in the exclusion of the marginalised.",
    "The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, (MHRD) has promoted the use of various digital learning portals like DIKSHA and SWAYAM. The use of these resources depends on access to electricity, computers, electronic devices and internet connectivity. But the spread of digital infrastructure in India is uneven. According to the Key Indicators of Household Social Consumption of Education in India, 2017-18, National Sample Survey, a mere 14.9 per cent of rural, and 42 per cent of urban households have access to internet facilities.",
    "Only 4.4 per cent of rural households and 23.4 per cent of urban households have access to computers. Moreover, a distinction has to made between access to the internet (in general) and internet access at home. For instance, 51 per cent of rural households in Kerala have access to the internet, but only 23 per cent have internet access at home. The percentages are much lower in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. According to the Niti Aayog, there are over 55,000 villages in India with no mobile connectivity. Children in the poorer districts of the country tend to do badly in terms of learning outcomes. The new interventions will aggravate their problems.",
    "According to the U-DISE report of 2016-2017, 73 per cent of India’s 1.04 million schools are government run. About 54 per cent of India’s school going children attend such schools. Unlike private schools, which are better equipped with e-learning solutions, the government and low-fee private schools are facing significant challenges. Moreover, most of the e-learning initiatives in the country focus on secondary, senior secondary and university education, creating an uncertain situation for elementary education. Digital infrastructure, even in the pre-COVID era, was at a nascent stage. The over-reliance on it in these testing times will create serious problems.",
    "Now that the government has given the go-ahead to “un-lockdowns”, there is a need to include education in the list of essential services, not strictly in terms of re-opening educational institutions but coming up with appropriate no-tech and low-tech solutions. This will ensure that the spirit of the Right to Education Act, 2009 is alive — bringing education to children if children cannot come to the educational institutions themselves.",
    "Taking advantage of the neighbourhood school clause (Section 6) of the Act and leveraging the well-connected post-office network, educational resources can be secured at the doorstep for every child irrespective of the place they live (rural or urban), COVID zones (containment or otherwise) or educational level (primary or secondary). On an average, one post office serves 21.56 sq km and a population of 7,753 people. They have been instrumental in ensuring the supply of medical and essential goods goods during the ",
    "pandemic",
    ", especially in the containment zones. This country-wide network can play a game-changing role in ensuring that the supply chain of education resources remains intact. The government of Portugal is reportedly contemplating similar steps.",
    "The teachers of the local neighbourhood government schools — on non-teaching COVID-related duties in Delhi, Rajasthan and Kerala — can be roped into the endeavour. They can be involved in creating or distributing printed material (created at the level of centre or states). These may be further broken down into simple lessons, preferably in local languages and dialects so that even first-generation learners can access them. The use of pictorial representation like flowcharts and concept maps should be encouraged.",
    "The network of School Leaders can play a pivotal role in encouraging parents to be a part of School Management Committees (SMCs). They can be a grievance redressal source and act as a bridge between the home and the school. There should be a mechanism to send the worksheets/workbooks back to the teachers using the services of the postal network (in predominantly rural settings) or mobile phones (wherever applicable).",
    "In addition to these no-tech interventions, use of low-tech solutions can help in mitigating the learning loss of students. Evidence suggests that the use of interactive radio instructions (IRI) leads to higher levels of student achievements, across age and social settings. Mobile monitoring and increasing teacher interaction, through simple interventions like phone-calls have produced positive outcomes in so far as student performance is concerned. Central and state governments can also provide subsidised TV sets, and internet connection for students who may need them.",
    "Reopening of educational institutions is reportedly amongst the last of the un-lockdown measures. Meanwhile, policy makers must ensure that equity and inclusion remain central to their plans on education.",

    "While currently international air travel is restricted to repatriation missions being flown by Indian as well as foreign carriers, the Centre has indicated that it is in discussions with various countries to establish air bridges. These include the US, Canada and several European countries. The concept of air bridges is based on reciprocity with the said countries allowing Indian citizens to fly into their borders and India allowing their citizens to fly into its borders.",
    "Several countries that have already put in place these air bridges or travel bubbles have done so on the basis of their perception of the ability of the destination country to handle the Covid19 pandemic. For example, New Zealand, which was completely able to contain the disease was establishing a trans-Tasmanian air bubble with other countries that had managed the virus spread. The three Baltic nations of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia had also established an air bubble among themselves with virtually no restrictions on travel. However, the perception of India based on the rising number of cases, especially on account that it has become the country with third highest number of cases, could throw a spanner in the works for the government trying to establish air bridges."

In between, he has to visit slums to distribute ration and to make sure things are running smoothly elsewhere in the jurisdiction.

    " patients, witnessed an eerie silence. Mumbai saw it’s first Covid-19 related death; a 63-year-old man who had travelled to Dubai. The death spooked everyone in the ward, except perhaps Rajeev (name changed on request), the ward boy.",
    "A senior approached Rajeev and gave him the task to prepare the dead body and move it to the mortuary from the isolation ward. Without hesitation, he prepared for the task. Having dealt with dead patients’ bodies that pose a high risk of infection in 2015 during the Swine-flu outbreak in the country, he knew the precautions he had to take.",
    "Rajeev first wore gloves, masks, eye-wear and a bodysuit. He then, along with a staff member, wrapped the senior citizen’s body in a leak-proof plastic bag, zipped till the neck, and moved it to the freezer. Rajeev, who is in his 30s said, “I am not scared at all. I take all precautions and safety measures. We did not wrap the body in the plastic bag until a family member had seen it. Because once it is zipped and moved to the mortuary freezer, it cannot be opened, the risk of infection then is high”.",
    "It was only after he transported the body to a biohazard-proof vehicle for electric cremation at Shivaji Park that he understood the scale of the work he had completed. His six-hour-long single shift was stretched to 24 hours and he was still not home. “I was tired that day. But the first thing I did after reaching home was to bathe again, eat well and get some sleep. The crucial thing I learnt about doing this work was to eat and sleep well. Many depend on alcohol to work in a mortuary, but I am against that. If I am not well-rested and fed, my chances of catching the infection are triple-fold,” explains Rajeev, who lives nearest to the hospital than his colleagues and is motivated by his wife to continue working and not skip his duty.",
    "Before the body was taken to Shivaji Park crematorium, six relatives spent the entire morning in the hospital trying to figure out how to go about the cremation of a ",

    "-infected body, and whether it would be allowed by civic authorities. A similar question troubled, Dr Virendra Mohite, Medical officer of Health (MOH) who was given the task to monitor the cremation. After arranging the personal protective equipment for the crematorium workers, Mohite headed out to meet them. “Shifting the Covid-19 positive patient and preparing for his cremation five days later were the most challenging tasks for the team. Until then the staff had been involved in the awareness campaign”.",
    "The body went straight from the ambulance to the incinerator. After the electric cremation, the staff — a team of five, burned their protective equipment, soaked their uniforms, and bathed. The crematorium did not accept any other bodies for cremation and barred any entry into the premises for a few hours.",

World Health Organisation (WHO) and AIIMS advise cremation — unless a family insists on burial for religious reasons — a request Mumbai civic body had not prepared for.

The first burial in the city was of a 68-year old Philippines national in the eastern suburb of Mumbai on March 24. As none of the family members could be present for the burial, the authorities had provided assistance. Following the concerns expressed by the community leader over the contamination, as most burial grounds are in densely populated localities, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued a circular emphasising on the cremation of the bodies.

    "Covid-19",
    " ",
    "pandemic",
    ", a key challenge for the Punjab government has been to ensure that the procurement of wheat is done in a seamless manner while adhering to health advisories.",
    "Mandis in Punjab are expecting about 18 lakh metric tones of wheat to arrive in the mandis as procurement starts from April 15. Although around 17 lakh farmers are engaged in wheat harvesting, the government is expecting the arrival of around 10-12 lakh farmers in the mandis to sell their produce. Add to that around 2,700 commission agents and almost 2 lakh labourers across the mandis in the states.",
    "The main task is to ensure that this massive procurement exercise happens while maintaining ",
    "social distancing",
    " norms. As a first step, this year, apart 1,434 mandis in Punjab, the government is using spaces reserved for rice shelling for unloading wheat. This means the total number of procurement points have already increased from less than 1,500 to 4,000 “so that farmers don’t gather at one place and social distancing can be maintained,” said Ravi Bhagat, Secretary Punjab Mandi Board (PMB) while talking with ",
    "The Indian Express",
    ".",
    "Wheat procurement involves lakhs of farmers and labourers (many from outside the state) as well as thousands of commission agents working in close proximity with each other. At a time when the central focus is to ensure social distancing, the Punjab government is using technology as well as other policy measures to ensure that procurement happens without incident.",
    "To further ease the pressure on everyone and reduce congestion in the mandis, the duration of the procurement process has been extended. “Normally our wheat procurement season’s duration is about 20 days only, but this time it has been spread out over 47 days—that is, from April 15-May 31,” explained Bhagat.",
    "In the same light, each mandi will be allowed to process only one-third the wheat they handled last year. The remaining produce will be diverted to new procurement centres. “For example, in Khanna, the largest mandi in Asia, the daily arrival of wheat during peak season is 1 lakh quintal but now, we have a cut-off of 30,000 quintals,” said Bhagat. Moreover, farmers from Rajasthan and Haryana have been banned from selling their produce in Punjab.",
    "To manage these efforts, the government is using IT. Starting with the arrival of wheat to its procurement by a private or government agency, the IT section of the Mandi Board will be shepherding the process.",
    "The IT staff has provided commission agents (or Ahrtiyas) with tokens (containing holograms), which the agents have distributed among farmers connected with them. Ahrtiyas have been told to get an entry pass issued for the farmers by punching the concerned farmer’s phone numbers, name and token number. This will allow a specific farmer to be told, through a mobile phone message, when they need to come to a procurement centre. This will also ensure that only a predesignated number of farmers enter the mandi at any particular time. The PMB has tied up with Ola for a dashboard that tracks the passes.",
    "Around 20 IT officials at PMB headquarters in Mohali and nearly 300 in the field (as data entry operators) will be working to make the system run in an organised manner.",
    "Maintaining hygiene and social distancing are prerequisites and hence elaborate steps have been taken to ensure these. All mandis, as well as rice shelling spaces (both open and closed), have been divided into 30 feet by 30 feet zones with instructions (written in Gurmukhi) about where to unload the wheat, where farmers are supposed to stand, where packing will be done etc. A distance of six metres is to be maintained between all individuals.",
    "“It is a huge exercise and our staff has not been sleeping properly for the past many days. Not only this, even Indian School of Business, Mohali, is studying our entire exercise as a part of their survey,” Bhagat added.",
    "Apart from social distancing, efforts have been made to ensure that all concerned have the facility to frequently wash their hands. Washbasins with foot-operated taps have been installed in mandis. Apart from necessarily wearing masks, labourers will be required to wash their hands every 30 minutes. The Tarantaran mandi has even installed a Covid-19 safety station for sanitizing everyone entering the mandi.",

    "It all started when a Twitter user made a claim that the author had allegedly liked a tweet that compared prescribed hormones to antidepressants. Soon, Rowling wrote a long tread defending herself and went to write, “I’ve ignored fake tweets attributed to me and RTed widely. I’ve ignored porn tweeted at children on a thread about their art. I’ve ignored death and rape threats. I’m not going to ignore this. When you lie about what I believe about mental health medication and when you misrepresent the views of a trans woman for whom I feel nothing but admiration and solidarity, you cross a line.”",
    "She added, “I’ve written and spoken about my own mental health challenges, which include OCD, depression and anxiety. I did so recently in my essay ‘TERF Wars’. I’ve taken anti-depressants in the past and they helped me. Many health professionals are concerned that young people struggling with their mental health are being shunted towards hormones and surgery when this may not be in their best interests. Many, myself included, believe we are watching a new kind of conversion therapy for young gay people, who are being set on a lifelong path of medicalisation that may result in the loss of their fertility and/or full sexual function.” Adding to this, she shared links to support her tweets, giving instances. “The long-term health risks of cross-sex hormones have been now been tracked over a lengthy period. These side-effects are often minimised or denied by trans activists.”",

    "September 23, 1896, could well be a landmark moment in the medical history of India. It was on this day that the first case of the Bombay plague was identified in Mandvi, Bombay (now Mumbai), by Dr. Acacio Gabriel Viegas, an Indian practitioner of Western medicine. Within a week, plague cases were reported from neighbouring areas, and by the end of the year, it had spread to all parts of the municipal corporation.",
    "In the next few years, the plague would spread from cities like Bombay, Pune, Karachi and Calcutta to the hinterlands. For two decades, the deadly Bombay plague ravaged across the Indian subcontinent like a hungry beast, claiming about 10 million lives. “The plague onslaughts which besieged India were part of the modern ",

    ", the third great, worldwide visitation of plague in recorded history,” writes historian Ira Klein in his research paper ‘",
    "Plague, policy and popular unrest in British India’",
    ". He goes on to write that during the plague of the late 19th century “India suffered terribly, far more than any other country”.",
    "By the early 20th century, the plague had acquired the reputation of being India’s most feared and one of its deadliest ailments. Not only did it induce massive fatalities, but it also emerged as a huge social disrupter, as millions evacuated their homes in big cities, and several others were detained in observation camps by local governments to control the spread of the disease.",
    "Also read: ",
    "Black death: The great plague that killed millions, and feudalism",
    "But perhaps the most far-reaching impact of the plague was upon the political atmosphere of the country. “The significance of plague for the political epidemiology of colonial India was far greater than that of the concurrent epidemics of malaria or influenza, even though in any given year the mortality they caused might have been considerably greater,” writes historian David Arnold in his book, ‘",
    "Colonising the body: State medicine and epidemic disease in nineteenth-century India.",
    "’ He explains that “because of the manner in which it was perceived by the colonial authorities and the nature of the sanitary and medical measures deployed against it, bubonic plague provoked an unparalleled crisis in the history of state medicine in India.”",
    "The 20th century French philosopher Michel Foucalt had propounded the theory suggesting that under colonial rule medicine and health policies had also become tools for colonising society. At no other point in Indian history was this more evident as that during the Bombay plague.",
    "At first, the administration in Bombay did not admit to the presence of the disease. But by October 1896, once they were forced to acknowledge the devastation the plague had brought about, they acted quickly and drastically. To begin with, an amendment to the Bombay Municipal Act of 1888 extended the powers entrusted to Bombay’s municipal commissioner. “The municipality simultaneously embarked on a massive, almost comically thorough, campaign of urban cleansing, flushing out drains and sewers with oceans of seawater and carbolic, scouring out scores of shops and grain warehouses, sprinkling disinfectant powder in alleyways and tenements, and, more tragically, destroying several hundred slum dwellings in the hope of extirpating the disease before it could fully establish itself,” writes Arnold.",
    "But these measures were soon found to be ineffective and as the threat of the epidemic spreading outside Bombay and Pune became real, a new legal provision was brought into place. The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, passed by the then Viceroy, Lord Elgin, was rushed through his council with hardly any debate and consultation. It came into immediate effect and applied to all of British India. Arnold writes that the Act “gave the government powers to inspect any ship or intending passenger; to detain and segregate plague suspects, to destroy infected property; search, disinfect, evacuate, open up for ventilation, or simply demolish any dwelling thought to harbour plague.”",
    "Further, in Bombay, Pune, Karachi, and Calcutta, responsibility for health and sanitation was taken away from municipal councils and handed over to small groups of European doctors and civil servants. Efforts were speeded up in Bombay and Pune as the army was appointed to bring military efficiency to the sanitary campaign.",
    "Also read: ",
    "The first plague in history ended the Byzantine empire, was considered an act of God",
    "“What was significant about this act is that it gave draconian powers to everyone in the colonial administration, including those in the lowest order, to check people at their will. Further, they could not be challenged in the court for the actions they took in the name of restricting the spread of the disease,” says historian Saurav Rai in a telephonic conversation with Indianexpress.com.",
    "Interestingly, despite the high handedness of the colonial government, the European population living in India at that time was largely unaffected. Rai explains “colonial medical policies always tried to hide the instances of diseases among the European population in India since that could challenge the power hierarchy in India.” “Consequently, cases of plague among Europeans in India went unreported, and there were separate arrangements made for them,” he adds.",

    "Arnold in his book writes that there were two main reasons for the relentless surveillance measures being taken by the British. “Fearing that this disease, like cholera before it, would spread from India to the rest of the world and invade Europe itself, other Western powers threatened and embargo on trade with India unless stringent measures were taken to suppress plague and prevent its transmission to Europe,” he writes.",
    "A second factor though was that the epidemic represented a crisis in urban control. The cities in India through which the disease ravaged- Bombay, Karachi, Calcutta, were the central nodes of colonial power in India. “Indeed one impetus behind the Epidemic diseases Act was to protect Calcutta from infection by Bombay, given the close commercial and administrative ties between the two cities,” writes Arnold.",
    "In his article, ‘",
    "Plague Panic and Epidemic Politics in India: 1896-1914’",
    ", historian Rajnarayan Chandavarkar writes that among the British there was the realisation that if the plague “spread through the subcontinent, it might devastate India’s social order and economic base, flatten the pivot of empire and undermine the foundation of Britain’s influence between the Yellow sea and the Red sea.”",
    "Also read: ",
    "How the 1896 plague epidemic shaped Mumbai",
    "The plague also became a pretext for an assault on the rising political consciousness among Indians in the early 20th century. In Pune, for instance, the plague came at a time when a consolidated political movement against British policies, particularly those during the famine was taking shape. The Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, which constituted of several well-known names of the Indian national movement, including that of Bal Gangadhar Tilak was at the forefront of it.",
    "The plague provided a most fitting excuse to strike back at the movement. In 1897, the Shivaji and Ganapati festivals started by Tilak to promote Hindu nationalism were banned on grounds of plague restrictions. Further, Tilak was imprisoned for a year for his alleged role in provoking the assassination of W C Rand, who was appointed as plague commissioner in the city. “But the government’s counterthrust was not directed at Tilak alone. It was also aimed at the Pune municipal council, of which Tilak was also a member and which British officials saw as Brahmin dominated, politically suspect and, administratively inept,” writes Arnold.",
    "Also read: ",
    "How smallpox cleared the way for European occupation of the Americas",
    "Unsurprisingly, the colonisers were soon met with drastic reactions from the Indian society. “The Epidemic Diseases Act was enforced without understanding the social structure in India at that time,” says Rai. “At that point in time, Indian society was strictly observing purdah or veil for women, and caste hierarchies. The rampant search operations, segrations and hospitalisations were often met with resistance since they were seen as an attack on social mores,” he adds.",
    "Perhaps the most common form of response to the plague measures was flight, as from most large towns and cities a substantial population simply ran away. Moreover, Europeans were attacked on the streets and a few even lynched.",
    "But as Chandravarkar writes, it was not just the plague measures, but also the way in which they were carried out that triggered the ire of the Indian populace. “Not surprisingly, there were complaints that all the females were compelled to come out of their homes and stand before the public gaze in the open street and be there subjected to inspection by soldiers. Soldiers were said to ‘behave disgracefully’ with native ladies,” he writes.",
    "Further, there were also complaints suggesting that there were wanton and indiscriminate destruction of property during searches. “The most common complaint concerned false diagnosis which resulted in ‘perfectly healthy persons being seized and forcibly taken away by the search parties,” writes Chandrakarvar. The government vociferously denied these allegations and hardly ever could they be proven.",
    "The most frenzied reaction to the plague measures were the protests and riots that followed. The most serious among these was the one that occurred on March 9, 1898 in Byculla, Bombay when a group of Julaha Muslim weavers fervently opposed the removal of a 12-year-old girl suspected of suffering from the plague. “A magistrate was wounded in the resulting fracas, and hospitals and other buildings were attacked and set on fire,” writes historian Natasha Sarkar in her article, ‘",

    "Rai goes on to explain that it would, however, be unfair to not keep in context the threat that plague posed to the Indian subcontinent at that point in time. “Maybe a number of these measures were genuinely required. But Indian society and politics were very volatile in the late 19th and early 20th century and things quickly went out of hand.”",

    "To intensify pineapple cultivation in the state, the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) centre in Tripura has designed a high-density, weed-resistant, climate-resilient pineapple cultivation technology.",
    "Tripura’s ‘queen’, or queen pineapple, was declared ‘state fruit’ by President Ramnath Kovind in 2018. However, the traditional cultivation practice has to deal with a lot of weeds and wild vegetation, leading to moisture wastage, low growth and a host of other problems.",

    "Speaking to ",
    "indianexpress.com",
    ", Biswajit Das, ICAR’s Principal Scientist, explained that in the new process, the plant bed has to be treated and processed prior the cultivation.",
    "Once the plants are ‘established’, no weed grows in the plot at all, cutting down on manpower use, increasing cost efficiency and ensuring effective soil nutrient management, he said.",
    "“In the new method, a black polypropylene sheet is placed on a raised soil bed before planting the pineapple plant. The plants are sown using planting suckers through the polypropylene sheet, which prevents any weed growth,” the scientist said.",
    "This method allows for use of both organic and chemical fertilisers in soil preparation. Vermi compost, cowdung manure or poultry manure can be used for organic cultivation while Urea, Potash, SSP etc. are the chemical fertilisers that can be chosen.",
    "Das explained this method ensures bigger growth of pineapples – upto 1.5 kg for the kew variety and 1.2-1.4 kg for Tripura’s very own ‘queen pineapple’.",
    "This is likely to help Tripura’s pineapple growers, who complain of the small fruit size impacting demand. Also, the method promises a higher yield.",
    "According to officials, the ICAR system ensures 43,000 plants per hectare, while in the traditional method, a maximum of 25,000 plants can be grown on a hectare.",
    "A senior government official, who didn’t wish to be named, said the ICAR research holds high potential and is likely to become popular among farmers once they practise it and are reassured of the cost efficiency.",
    "Tripura grows an estimated 1.28 lakh MT pineapples every year, across 8,800-hectare orchards in different districts. Some of these orchards are run by the government, but most are privately owned. Over 4,000 people are directly connected to the cultivation of the fruit here.",

    "The Assam government on Monday decided to upgrade Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary into a national park. The announcement comes just months after the National Board of Wildlife’s (NBWL) conditional ",
    "clearance to a coal mining",
    " project by Coal India Limited (CIL) in the Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve sparked a spate of virtual protests in the state. Subsequently, North Eastern Coalfields (NEC), the CIL subsidiary, temporarily suspended all mining operations in the region.",
    "“Our Govt has decided to upgrade the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary in Assam, which is home to a vast variety of flora and fauna, to a National Park. In a meeting with senior officials in Guwahati today, I have directed them to take necessary steps in this regard,” tweeted Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Monday afternoon.",
    "The 111.942 sq km Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary is located within the larger Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve, which spreads across the coal- and oil-rich districts of Upper Assam (",
    "Dibrugarh",
    ", Tinsukia and Sivasagar) and is believed to be the last remaining contiguous patch of lowland rainforest area in Assam.",
    "However, state Environment and Forest Minister, Parimal Suklabaidya, said the announcement is not related to the mining controversy. “We had been considering the upgrade for a while now,” he said,“ Dehing Patkai is our property, our pride and we have to do our best to preserve it. As a national park, its importance will increase and new rules will bring increased vigilance to the area.”",
    "While wildlife sanctuaries are protected areas which permit some activities such as grazing, experts say national parks call for a complete protection status under The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.",
    "“[Some] human activities can be allowed inside a wildlife sanctuary, but no human activity is allowed in a national park,” said AM Singh, Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCCF) and Head of Forest Force.",
    "A release from the Chief Minister’s Office on Monday evening said Sonowal “directed the forest department to take necessary action for up-grading Dehing Patkai into a national park in consultation with the Union Environment and Forest Ministry.”",
    "It added that Sonowal had directed the forest department to “prepare a draft notification and hold a public hearing to take the views of local dwellers” residing around the sanctuary. Further directions included preparing an “action plan for preserving the adjoining areas of the wildlife sanctuary” and including “the opinion of the public in the adjoining areas in the draft action plan.”",
    "PCCF Singh said that a “long process” precedes the park’s final notification. “According to the Wildlife Protection Act, between the draft and final notification, you will have to give time for public hearings, listen to stakeholders, neighbouring villages, consider their queries, and make settlements etc,” he said, “We have only initiated the process now.”",
    "While the first proposal to accord national park status to the region dates back to 1995, Dehing Patkai was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 2004.",
    "“Apart from the fact that is a contiguous patch of rainforest, it is also the place with the highest concentration of the rare endangered White Winged Wood Duck can be found,” said wildlife expert Dr Anwaruddin Choudhury, a former joint secretary of forest department, who had first proposed an area of 267 sq km to be earmarked for the national park in 1995.",
    "While in its current status, the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary includes parts of the Upper Dihing, Joypur and Dirak Reserve Forests, it is not yet known what areas the notified national park will include, and if the overall area of the park will be larger. “Right now, we are only taking the current wildlife sanctuary into account. We will consider extensions later,” said Suklabaidya.",
    "The site of NEC’s mining project is 9.19 km from the sanctuary.",
    "An official from the forest department said on condition of anonymity, that extending the sanctuary’s boundaries may not be easy. “Many agencies like Coal India Limited, Oil India Limited have leases in the area. Those will have to be settled. Community views have to be considered,” he said, “The curb on mining activities will depend on how exactly the boundary is defined,” he added.",
    "Post upgradation, Dehing Patkai will be the sixth national park in Assam — the other five being Kaziranga, Nameri, Manas, Orang and Dibru-Saikhowa.",

    "Dark chocolate and yogurt",
    "Both these ingredients are easily available, and are known to be great for the health of the skin. Yogurt can clean your face, open the pores and tighten its texture, while dark chocolate can improve the circulation of blood and give it a never-seen-before glow. In order to make this pack, you will need to melt a few dark chocolate cubes and keep it in a bowl. To this, add two tablespoons of fresh yogurt, preferably homemade. Mix the two together so that it becomes an even paste, and then apply it on the face and the neck region after you have washed yourself. Let it dry for 15-20 minutes, following which you can clean it off with regular water. Massage as you take the mask off. The difference will be noticeable.",
    "Dark chocolate and honey",
    "This another skincare favourite that many people love making and applying. While the benefits of dark chocolate are known, the honey in the face mask ensures that dry skin is moisturised and sensitive skin is relieved. To make this, you will need a little bit of melted dark chocolate, one teaspoon of honey, and few drops of lemon juice. Mix them well together to make a paste, which you can then generously apply on the face and the neck. Let it dry for a few minutes, after which you can wash it off with water.

Mix the two together to make a consistent paste. Apply it on the face and the neck, and after 20 minutes, wash it off with water and pat dry. Remember to massage well, and wear this pack at least twice every week.",
    "Every skin type is different and while dark chocolate is harmless, you can start with a patch test first. If you do not have a bar at home, you can buy one from your local grocery shop, but remember it has to be dark chocolate only.",

    "’s State Councillor Wang Yi, a movement towards de-escalation is said to be taking place in the military build-up at the ",
    "Line of Actual Control",
    ". Chinese soldiers are said to be stepping back in three of the contentious areas — Galwan, Hot Springs and Gogra. This is a development in the right direction. However, the verification process by the Indian Army is still underway, and it should continue to be so. After all, the incident at Galwan Valley in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, took place at a time when the two sides were supposed to be disengaging. Moreover, there appears no de-escalation at the other “friction point”, Finger 4 at Pangong Lake. In any case, disengagement does not mean a return to status quo ante yet. At Sunday’s Special Representatives meeting, the two officials reiterated their commitment to the maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas. But the distinct difference in the tone and tenor of the readouts of this meeting put out by the Ministry of External Affairs and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs draws attention to the hazards of jumping to conclusions. According to the Chines",
    "The challenges ahead for India remain enormous. One is the sheer length of the LAC — 4,000 km of it, compared to the Line of Control which is 740 km. Apart from the disputed portions that already exist and that both sides have discussed in several previous rounds of talks between the Special Representatives, there is now an unpredictability as China disputes portions on which there was no ambiguity earlier. India’s perception of the Galwan Valley was not disputed by the Chinese before this summer. A give in one part of this long unmarked boundary may be accompanied by take somewhere else. In the latest demonstration of this unpredictability, China has now opened a new front, staking claim to territory in eastern Bhutan, close to the border of Arunachal Pradesh. This “eastern sector” had never been part of 24 rounds of boundary talks between Bhutan and China. The claim, which first came to light when China tried to block UN funding to the Sakteng wildlife reserve in that area, was reite",

    "That is how people acquainted with Ravinder Dandiwal,",
    " who was arrested for ",
    "his alleged role match-fixing",
    ", describe him.",
    "Last week, Dandiwal was identified by Victoria Police in Australia as the ‘central figure in a global match-fixing and betting scam’, according to a Sydney Morning Herald investigation. He was then linked to a fake T20 league that was claimed to be held in Sri Lanka but was staged in a village in Punjab instead.",
    "Mohali SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal said Dandiwal was arrested after interrogation of two other accused and they are exploring his connections to the fake T20 league.",
    "But those who have known him, and been associated with his tournaments, are hardly surprised with the developments, saying Dandiwal ran a ‘shady syndicate’ in ",
    "Chandigarh",
    "/Mohali/Panchkula for a long time and had been virtually ostracised in the local cricket community in the last couple of years.",
    "Read | ",
    "Hideouts of accused in fake Sri Lankan league scam raided",
    "Dandiwal, 35, came to the city around 2009-10 and started a cricket academy in Mohali, according to a local coach. Another former associate said: “Sometimes, he would say he is from Rajasthan. On some other occasions, he used to claim he is from Punjab.”",
    "\nChahal, the Mohali SSP, confirmed Dandiwal was from Rajasthan. “After interrogation of the two accused arrested earlier, the Mohali Police arrested the kingpin of fixing racket Ravinder Singh Dandiwal, son of Gurnam Singh and resident of house number 108, Nohar, Hanumangarh, Rajasthan from Mohali on July 5,” Chahal said at a press conference.",
    "Dandiwal, however, never gave away much about himself or his family. “He made a lot of claims of being well connected but never said in what way and how. There were rumours that his father was some sort of a contractor, another story was his family was in the liquor trade,” said a media consultant, who devised promotional strategies for Dandiwal’s tournaments. “One of the few things he spoke openly about was his ambition to make a name in the international cricket industry.”",
    "It started by going hyper-local. A Chandigarh-based coach said that soon after he launched his academy, Dandiwal held a talent-hunt series for a year from August 2010 to August 2011. “After that, in 2012, he started the Cricket Premier League, which was also broadcast live on DD Sports,” the coach says. “But a lot of professional players from Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula gave the tournament a miss since it was not a recognised tournament by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).”",
    "Instead, the tournament was held under the aegis of Cricket Council of India, of which Dandiwal claimed to be the general secretary on his social media profiles. The Cricket Council of India’s logo bears a striking resemblance to BCCI’s, including the colour and font. The shape of its edges and the organisation’s name – in tiny characters – are the few visible differences.",
    "The Chandigarh-based body ran the Cricket Academy of India and routinely organised training camps and state selection trials for the National League Cricket Championship, another non-BCCI recognised tournament played in Chandigarh in 2015. The Cricket Council of India went on to organise a lot of tournaments that had names similar to the ones conducted by the BCCI. For instance, in 2016 Dandiwal organised a ‘Champions Trophy’ apart from being associated with the Haryana Corporate League, Punjab Cricket League and Cricket Premier League in the last few years.",
    "Dandiwal called himself the chairman of the Cricket Premier League and formed a sport-cum-player management firm, Ultimate Sports Management, of which he was the managing director. According to the league’s former media consultant, Dandiwal drove around in a sedan, liked a flashy lifestyle.",
    "A coach from Panchkula said: “Dandiwal arranged players from places like Jaipur and small towns in Jammu and Kashmir as well as Punjab. He lured them by saying they will get a chance to represent India.”",
    "A well-known coach from Chandigarh said Dandiwal chased him for several weeks to visit one of the coaching camps he had arranged. “This happened around six years ago. He kept on insisting that I visit his academy so I travelled to Mohali, and met the players at the ground for an hour or so. He clicked pictures and after that, I have not been in touch with him,” the coach said.",
    " ",
    "One cricketer-turned-sports entrepreneur said, ““The players he got for his tournaments were all unknown and they claimed to be from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. He used to mix and match the teams. It’s not like the team from Rajasthan had just Rajasthani players,” the entrepreneur said.",
    "One of Cricket Premier League’s former media consultants added: “They were called national tournaments but had all local players. There used to be teams from 10-15 states but we did not know from where they were actually. He used to collect entry fees from teams and players, put them up at shady hotels and the matches were conducted in a very strange manner. There were no set match timings or fixture lists, no rules with regards to who would be allowed to sit on the bench and if a team could not get 11 players, then players from other teams would be added to make up the numbers.”",
    "Still, Dandiwal’s tournaments gained popularity within the local circles and soon, he started organising similar matches outside India. But after his name got linked to a match-fixing scandal in a tournament he organised in Nepali in 2017 – the Asian Premier League – the doors started slamming shut on him.",
    "“He held a tournament in Nepal and after that, his name featured in BCCI’s anti-corruption thing. Later, I heard that he took a team to Australia and a lot of players escaped and never returned. I did not want any negative image to be associated with my academy so I advised my players not to play in his teams or tournaments and I stopped giving him my grounds,” said the player-turned-sports entrepreneur.",

So, a hospital that intends to continue operations needs to double its personnel, so they can work in cycles — such as a week’s work being followed by a week’s quarantine. Besides procuring equipment, PPE kits, ventilators, etc., governments should focus on recruiting larger numbers of healthcare workers. It is indeed the need of the hour.",

    "Directed by Neeraj Pandey, MS Dhoni The Untold Story was a biopic that followed the cricketer’s story right from his childhood in Ranchi till the point he hit that memorable shot which led to India’s 2011 World Cup win. The historic moment is still ingrained in every Indian’s mind, so, in the film, it had to be spot on, and with Sushant’s laser focus, it was spectacular to watch.",
    "The film had a linear storytelling structure. We saw Dhoni’s childhood, his early days in cricket, his family life, his days as a ticket collector and how, through it all, his passion for cricket never ceased. While as a film, this cannot be called a great biopic, mainly due to its pacing issues, Pandey certainly encapsulated the film’s spirit by casting the right actor for the job.",
    "I remember stepping out of the theater and not being impressed by the film’s duration, which was a little over three hours. I also did not appreciate how the makers chose to sidestep all the controversies from MS Dhoni’s life, that were very much in the public eye. Yet, what moved me was the perseverance that was visible in Sushant Singh Rajput’s mannerisms through the film. I won’t lie and say that I loved every movie of the late actor, but he was certainly one of those who left a mark after you saw him on the silver screen. And the same holds true for MS Dhoni The Untold Story.",
    "The film also starred Disha Patani and Kiara Advani. Disha’s character was given an ominous tone right from the start, and Kiara’s character felt like it was added because it was an essential part of Dhoni’s real life. Compared to this, his early days with ",

    "The maestro’s success arrived in the 1960s and 70s, when he composed for Westerns – a subgenre of films set in the late 19th century ",
    "United States",
    " (or the “Old West”), where gun-toting cowboys run into adventures ending in revenge or retribution. His music for Sergio Leone’s Dollar trilogy (‘A Fistful of Dollars’, 1964; ‘For a Few Dollars More, 1965; ‘The Good, the Bad and the Ugly’, 1966) brought Morricone international fame. Hugely successful, the films also propelled actor Clinton Eastwood to stardom.",
    "The trilogy’s background music, with its coyote howl, harmonicas and eerie whistling, has since achieved cult status, being imitated or adapted in films and television programmes around the world. The song ‘The Ecstasy of Gold’ from ‘The Good, the Bad and the Ugly’ remains among Morricone’s biggest hits.",
    "Morricone’s film scores are marked by the use of unconventional instruments such as the Jew’s harp, amplified harmonica, mariachi trumpets, cor anglais, and the ocarina. He also used real sounds such as whistling, cracking of whips and gunshots.",
    "His work on Westerns apart, ‘Maestro Morricone’, as many referred to him, was a highly versatile artiste who wrote music across genres – from comedy, historical films, crime dramas, and thrillers. His non-Western classics included Roland Joffe’s 1986 film ‘The Mission’, and Sergio Leone’s ‘Once Upon a Time in America’ of 1984.",
    "Over 50 years, Morricone wrote around 500 scores, and worked with top filmmakers from around the world, including Sergio Leone, Giuseppe Tornatore, Mike Nichols, Brian De Palma, Roman Polanski, Barry Levinson, Terrence Malick, Oliver Stone, Warren Beatty, John Carpenter and Quentin Tarantino. His body of work includes around 100 concert pieces, mostly recorded in later life.",
    "His global reach notwithstanding, Morricone only spoke Italian; never bothering to learn English nor living in Hollywood. In 1969, he co-founded the famous Rome recording studio ‘Forum Music Village’. Morricone also composed the official theme for the 1978 FIFA World Cup.",
    "Over his career, Morricone won several awards internationally, including four Grammys, two Golden Globes, and an honorary Oscar in 2007– after being nominated six times. When his work for ‘The Mission’ (1986) did not win an Oscar, it so enraged award observers that the Academy’s rules had to be changed, according to a report in Variety. It was only in 2015 that Morricone won his first competitive Oscar for Tarantino’s ‘The Hateful Eight’.",

    " that “the deepening conflict between India and China is bound to complicate the prospects for an Asian century, as well as the Chinese century”.",
    "But he cautions: “As China privileges nationalism, it is bound to compel its Asian neighbours to do the same”.",
    "The idea of Asian unity was among the many transcendental political notions that emerged in the late-19th and early-20th centuries as the eastern civilisations struggled to rediscover themselves amidst the domination of the West.",
    "“The current president of China, Xi Jinping continues to talk about Asian unity. But for a very different purpose. For Deng, Asian unity was central to his strategy of rebuilding China. At home, he was determined to heal the scars from Mao’s blood-letting under the ",
    "Cultural Revolution",
    " that lasted from the mid-1960s to the 1970s. Deng also put an end to Mao’s external adventurism that destabilised the neighbouring states in the name of promoting revolution…Deng rightly saw peace on its frontiers and cooperation with the rest of the world as a precondition for modernising China,” he says.",
    "“Xi has a very different objective. He is leading a country that has emerged as a great power, thanks to the sweeping reforms under Deng. For Xi, Asian unity is about getting Beijing’s neighbours to acquiesce in China’s regional primacy”.",
    "However, Raja Mohan ",
    "points out",
    ", it is in an unfortunate paradox that the phenomenal rise of China may have created the very conditions for the demise of the Asian century. “That China has become far more powerful than all of its Asian neighbours has meant Beijing no longer sees the need to evoke Asian unity”.",
    "But if powerful nationalism is driving China to seek more territory from its neighbours and dominate the region, equally intense nationalist forces in Asia will react against CCP’s assertive policies, he argues.",
    "“To be sure, an India that is smaller in economic size than China will pay a price for being the first to challenge the Chinese century. But Delhi may be strong enough to extract a cost from Beijing which is discounting the enormous power of the nationalist sentiment that the CCP is unleashing in China’s neighbourhood,” he concludes.",

    "In July 2015, when the highly acclaimed musical ‘Hamilton’ hit the Broadway theatre, it had already sold out over 200,000 tickets in advance bringing in close to $30 million to the box office. Within months, not only did the theatrical adaptation of the life of Alexander Hamilton become one of the biggest successes in Broadway’s history, but it also managed to bag 11 Tony awards, a Pulitzer prize, and a Grammy. While on one hand, the theatre circle was gushing over the flawless depiction of America’s founding fathers, on the other hand, the White House was simultaneously smitten, as the then first lady, Michelle Obama, described Hamilton as the “best piece of art in any form that I have ever seen in my life.”",

    "Hamilton review: Play it on a loop",
    "Many would say that Hamilton was a perfect adaptation for the Obama presidency years. The musical created by actor, composer and singer Lin-Manuel Miranda was seen as an emblem of diversity and hope, as it charted the life of the immigrant Hamilton, who soon rose to become the first Secretary of Treasury, and the right-hand man of the first US president, George Washington. Equally admired was its modern form of storytelling that drew heavily from hip hop, and made a political statement in its casting of Black, Latino, and Asian actors to depict white historical figures.",

    "George Floyd",
    " though, ‘Hamilton’ is being seen in a new light. As statues of slave traders and those of celebrated colonial figures ",
    "have come to be toppled",
    " in the past few weeks, the historical legacy of Hamiton too has come to be dissected now. We do know that Hamilton had a role to play in the emancipation of slaves in America. But the degree of his involvement and complacency in the slave trade is being keenly studied in the context of the newer developments in America.",
    "The opening lines of the Broadway musical, describe Hamilton in the following words: “How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean by Providence impoverished in squalor grow up to be a hero and a scholar?”",
    "In the pages of American history, Hamilton would stand out for the unique trajectory of his life. He was born out of wedlock in the island of Nevis in the West Indies in the year 1757, at a time when the ratio between Black slaves and white residents was 12 is to one. He was orphaned at the age of 11, and though his mother did leave him a slave in her will, he did not acquire him on account of his status of being an illegitimate offspring.",
    "As a teenager, Hamilton worked as a clerk for the Beekman and Cruger Company that dealt in sugar and African slaves. Even though he was involved quite a bit in the paperwork, he rarely worked directly in the process of slave transfer. “He was alarmed at the condition of these human beings, but he remained a part of the business, participating, at least indirectly, in buying and selling human beings,” wrote American historian James Oliver Horton, in his article, ‘Alexander Hamilton: Slavery and race in revolutionary generation.’ Horton explained that “Hamilton was caught in a system of slavery that he increasingly disliked, but at this early age he had neither the power nor the will to move against it.”",

    "In 1772, Hamilton managed to move out of the Caribbean islands through the assistance of his aunt and land in New Jersey. Soon after, he enrolled himself in King’s College (now Columbia university). From his early years in New York, Hamilton became acutely aware of American discontent against British rule. As he grew more involved in the freedom movement, his speeches were replete with comparisons being drawn with slavery. “All men have one common original: they participate in one common nature, and consequently have one common right,” he wrote in 1774. Consequently, he argued that there was no reason why “one man should exercise any power or pre-eminence over his fellow-creatures. . . unless they have voluntarily vested him with it.”",
    "He also actively supported the cause of slaves being freed in order for them to join the American cause against the British. “By the end of the Revolution, thousands of slaves gained freedom; some left for Europe or Canada with the withdrawing British troops, some were freed as a result of service with Continental forces,” wrote Horton.",
    "In January 1785, Hamilton along with about 30 New Yorkers formed the New-York Society for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves. The organisation sought to end slavery in New York state, even though a majority of its members were themselves slaveholders. However, their consistent efforts led to the passage of the first emancipation law in 1799, and gradually in the course of the next three decades, slavery ended in New York. Even though Hamilton died in 1804 and did not live to see the complete emancipation of slaves in New York, he is credited to a large degree for having made it possible.",
    "Hamilton lent his support to the slave movements outside of America as well. For instance, when in 1792 a slave revolt led to Haiti’s independence from France, Hamilton supported it wholeheartedly, and in fact pressed for close economic ties with the newly formed state.",
    "In the political landscape of 18th century America, Hamilton had several other significant contributions to make. He led the Annapolis convention of 1786, which eventually led to the drafting of the ",
    "United States",
    "’ Constitution. He also wrote 51 of the 85 installments of the Federalist Papers which are still used as one of the most important references for interpreting the Constitution. As a trusted member of President Washington’s first cabinet, Hamilton led the department of Treasury.",
    "Even though at the time of its release in 2015, Hamilton did receive admiration from critics and audiences alike, historians and political scientists expressed their disapproval regarding the accuracy of the protagonist’s depiction. Writing in a New York Times editorial in June 2016, authors Jason Frank and Isaac Kramnick noted, “the musical avoids an equally pronounced feature of Hamilton’s beliefs: his deeply ingrained elitism, his disdain for the lower classes and his fear of democratic politics.” They go on to explain that Hamilton in fact had no faith in the capacities of the common man and insisted on deference to the elites.",
    "“Hamilton’s opposition to slavery — reflected, for example, in his being a founder of New York’s Manumission Society — was not central to his political vision. The musical’s suggestion that had he not been killed in the duel with Aaron Burr, Hamilton would have gone on to play an important role in the abolitionist struggle is fantasy,” wrote Frant and Kramnick.",

    " culture reporter, Jennifer Schuessler, who in August 2016, reported on the historians’ backlash that the musical was receiving, noted in her article how most historians were critical of the ‘coloured’ casting of the show to represent white historical characters, which they believed did injustice to the diverse group of people who contributed in the American revolution. “Some scholars have also noted that it’s an odd moment for the public to embrace an unabashed elitist who liked big banks, mistrusted the masses and at one point called for a monarchical presidency and a Senate that served for life,” wrote Schuessler.",
    "In 2020 though, the critique of the musical has taken a whole new colour, in light of the Black Lives Matter movement. Most social media users criticising the show have pointed out at Hamilton’s background of a slave trader and the fact that he married into a slave-trading family. There are others though, who have taken to social media to urge viewers to watch ‘Hamilton’ as an artistic expression rather than a history textbook.",

    "The New York Times reported recently that ",
    "239 scientists from 32 countries",
    " ",
    "have written an open letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) that the virus causing ",
    "Covid-19",
    " can remain airborne for a period of time and thus transmit itself. The scientists have “outlined the evidence showing that smaller particles can infect people, and are calling for the agency to revise its recommendation”. The paper titled ‘It is Time to Address Airborne Transmission of Covid-19’ is likely to be published in a scientific journal next week.",
    "What does this mean?",
    "A respiratory infection such as Covid-19 is transmitted through droplets of different sizes. If the droplets particles are larger than 5-10 microns in diameter, they are referred to as respiratory droplets; if they are smaller than 5 microns in diameter, they are referred to as droplet nuclei. “According to current evidence, Covid-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes,” the WHO states.",
    "However, the letter written by the scientists suggests aerosol transmission too can happen.",
    "In other words, the WHO’s viewpoint is that droplets containing the virus, produced during speech, coughing, sneezing etc, are larger than 5-10 microns in diameter and eventually succumb to gravity and fall to the ground after travelling less than 1 metre. The 239 scientists, on the other hand, are citing evidence that the virus can be present in droplet nuclei (less than 5 microns in diameter) that do travel distances longer than 1 metre, and can remain in the air for a longer time.",
    "If this can be established, it will mean that the risk of transmission is higher than previously thought.",
    "Is this a new revelation?",
    "As per the WHO, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings. These include settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed; endotracheal intubation; bronchoscopy; open suctioning; administration of nebulised treatment; manual ventilation before intubation; turning a patient to the prone position; disconnecting a patient from the ventilator; non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation; tracheostomy; and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",
    "Referring to the NYT report, the WHO has stated that “initial findings need to be interpreted carefully.” If the evidence being cited has to be examined, researchers will look at the specific settings in which the virus was found airborne, the duration for which the virus was found staying in the air, and, most importantly, whether the virus continues to be infectious throughout this duration.",

    "What if the claim is established?",
    "It means that wearing a mask becomes more important than ever. It might be possible that N-95 masks, which are used by clinicians in hospital settings, could now be recommended to prevent aerosol transmission, subject to availability, and depending on the health condition of a person.",
    "What is the evidence so far on the aerosol transmission?",
    "*",
    " One of the first studies, published in Nature, was conducted in Renmin Hospital and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital in Wuhan. It investigated the aerodynamic nature of the virus SARS-CoV-2 by measuring its viral RNA in aerosols.",
    "The study found that the concentration of the virus in aerosols detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was “very low”, but it was “higher in the toilet areas used by the patients”. “Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the most public areas was undetectable, except in two areas that were prone to crowding,” the study stated. “Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted through aerosols.”",
    "*",
    " In April, a correspondence published on NEJM by researchers from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the ",
    "United States",
    " evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 (and SARS-CoV-1, which causes SARS) in aerosols and on various surfaces. It found that SARS-CoV-2 “remained viable in aerosols” throughout the duration of the experiment that lasted for three hours. “Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours,” the study said.",
    "WHO, disagreeing with the findings of NEJM article, said, “… The finding of COVID-19 virus in aerosol particles up to 3 hours does not reflect a clinical setting in which aerosol-generating procedures are performed—that is, this was an experimentally induced aerosol-generating procedure.”",
    "*",
    " In May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), published a study titled “High SARS-CoV-2 Attack Rate Following Exposure at a Choir Practice”. The researchers, who studied “superspreading events”, found that following 2.5-hour choir practice attended by 61 persons, including a symptomatic index patient, 32 confirmed and 20 probable secondary Covid-19 cases occurred; three patients were hospitalised, and two died.",

    "The study noted that “the act of singing” itself — might have contributed to “transmission through the emission of aerosols, which is affected by the loudness of vocalization”. “Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events,” it said.",
    "“… Aerosol emission during speech has been correlated with loudness of vocalization, and certain persons, who release an order of magnitude more particles than their peers, have been referred to as superemitters and have been hypothesized to contribute to superspeading events. Members had an intense and prolonged exposure, singing while sitting 6–10 inches from one another, possibly emitting aerosols,” it said.",

In spite of our prices being 8%-10% more expensive than other premium TV brands, we were surprised to see overwhelming sales for this product range.

The lockdown has also changed the status quo for the TV industry with consumers now willing to prioritize brands who offer direct consumer service and promise durability as opposed to low cost TVs that have been flooding the Indian markets in the past few years. The change in consumer demand has also added new age brands in the Indian marketplace with Vu being the fastest and selling TV brand on Amazon and Flipkart in June 2020. Vu Televisions has not commented on any upcoming launches yet but the brand continues to focus on innovation which has become Vu’s prime driver for sales.",

It was then my husband suggested that I can start delivering food in the neighbourhood, and when I floated the idea on a residents’ WhatsApp group, I was flooded with orders,” she says.",
    "The first few days were a struggle, says Haryal, a resident of Delhi’s Panchsheel Park, as sourcing packaging material was tough and she wasn’t used to being in the kitchen for such long hours. “I didn’t cook as much before, but I’m loving it now, and it has especially taken my mother by surprise,” she says. Her menu ranges from Indian snacks to Chinese and Mughlai dishes, and she calls her brand Home Gourmet. “What has encouraged me is that there have been repeat orders,” she adds. It is either her driver who does the deliveries, or she uses delivery service apps like Dunzo. “There were more weekday deliveries during the lockdown, now people order more during weekends,” she said.",
    "Apart from dimsums, which sell for about Rs 150 to 200, her range of home made achars have also been a top seller. Haryal makes it a point to take orders a day in advance to plan the cooking for the next day. “If people don’t pre-order, they ask me what I am cooking that day and then place their orders of the same dishes,” she says. Daily family meals at her home are also planned accordingly.",

People tend to trust them more than restaurants as they are familiar with those in the neighbourhood and it is home-cooked food. “We assure people that we have no movement of staff in our house, and it’s just us cooking. It raises the trust factor, and they choose us over restaurants,” says Akriti Sehgal, a policy researcher, who has started a similar venture with her mother and grandmother.

It would also be a source of income,” she says. “My nani is a spectacular cook, and we’ve inherited that from her. So I thought of going back to my family recipes,” she says. Under the brand Mom’s Kitchen Fable, Sehgal along with her mother and nani prepare food in their home, which they deliver in Panchsheel Park, Greater Kailash and East of Kailash areas of New Delhi. “We deliver the food ourselves, otherwise what difference would it make,” she says.

    "In case you have been debating over the usage of irregardless in a sentence, you might want to stop. Merriam-Webster has just recognised it as a real word. Needless to say, it has caused a huge uproar. Anticipating this and even having fun at the expense, they shared on their website: “It has come to our attention lately that there is a small and polite group of people who are not overly fond of the word irregardless.” Reasoning their choice, they further stated, The reason we, and these dictionaries above, define irregardless is very simple: it meets our criteria for inclusion. This word has been used by a large number of people (millions) for a long time (over two hundred years) with a specific and identifiable meaning (“regardless”).”",
    "Taking cognisance of the criticism that there already exists the word ‘regardless’ that means the same, they wrote:  “The fact that it is unnecessary, as there is already a word in English with the same meaning (regardless) is not terribly important; it is not a dictionary’s job to assess whether a word is necessary before defining it. The fact that the word is generally viewed as nonstandard, or as illustrative of poor education, is likewise not important; dictionaries define the breadth of the language, and not simply the elegant parts at the top.”",
    "Going on to define the word, they stated, “We define irregardless, even though this act hurts the feelings of many. Why would a dictionary do such a thing? Do we enjoy causing pain? Have we abdicated our role as arbiter of all that is good and pure in the English language? These are all excellent questions (well, these are all questions), and you might ask them of some of these other fine dictionaries, all of whom also appear to enjoy causing pain through the defining of tawdry words.”",

    "She was also categoric in her evidence that though she attempted to make a noise, the accused prevented her from doing so by closing her mouth using his hand, the Court observed. Noting that the accused has no case that the first instance of sexual intercourse was consensual, the Court said the victim girl deposed that she did not disclose the incident to her mother due to fear.",
    "Similarly, she deposed that she did not disclose the incident to anyone as she was afraid that the accused would do something to her mother and sister, the court said. “In other words, it is clear from the materials on record that the victim was under a social and psychological hierarchical threat. In a situation of this nature, according to me, the conduct on the part of the victim in surrendering before the accused as and when desired by him cannot be said to be unusual or abnormal and such surrender can never be construed as consensual acts of sexual intercourse,” the court said.",
    "“It is now settled that mere act of helpless resignation in the face of inevitable compulsion, quiescence, non-resistance, or passive giving in, when volitional faculty is either clouded by fear or vitiated by duress, cannot be deemed to be consent as understood in law and the consent, on the part of a woman as a defence to an allegation of rape, requires voluntary participation, not only after the exercise of intelligence, based on the knowledge of the significance and moral quality of the act, but after having freely exercised a choice between resistance and assent,” the court said.",
    "Dismissing the appeal, the court also referred to the observation made on rape survivors by Judith Lewis Herman, an American psychiatrist and researcher on traumatic stress in her book ‘Trauma and Recovery’ that when a person is completely powerless, and any form of resistance is futile, she may go into a state of surrender. The system of self-defence shuts down entirely. The helpless person escapes from her situation not by action in the real world but rather by altering her state of consciousness.",

    "When Jaichand Desai (name changed) met with a motorcycle accident in February, little did he know that an injured kneecap would be the least of his worries. He lives in Peth village, in Dahanu taluka (Palghar district of Maharashtra), where the most favoured major public hospital is the Vinobha Bhave civil hospital in Silvassa (in the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli).",
    "On the day of the accident, a private ambulance said it would charge him Rs 18,000 for the 70-km drive. Since it was both exorbitant and unaffordable, he had to rely on a kind neighbour who drove him there for free. He had surgery for the damaged kneecap but when it was time for a follow-up in March, the ",
    "COVID-19",
    " lockdown had kicked in and he could not travel to the hospital.",
    "People in these parts prefer the civil hospital in Silvassa, which, despite the rush, cares for people in the most humane way possible. It also ensures that all government benefits are given to patients. It has a team of experts who perform specialised operations. If Silvassa can manage to run a public hospital in a streamlined fashion, why can’t a large state with adequate funds, do the same thing? In fact, of late, the Silvassa hospital is also turning away patients not from its own area. The number of patients from Maharashtra is quite high and the reasons are not far to seek.",
    "The closest hospital to Peth is the sub-district hospital at Kasa, 8 km away, which had to be shut down for a while after a doctor who had come there to set up the COVID ward fell ill. Even in non-COVID times, this hospital barely manages to function and is not exactly a go-to place, though thankfully, it has stocks of anti-venom which is much in demand. Recently, they sent a local journalist, who was admitted there with fever, to a private hospital in Dahanu for treatment after a week.",
    "Meanwhile, Desai’s knee did not heal, and in June, he approached various hospitals, including a private one at Dhundhalwadi, only to be turned away. His X- rays, taken in a private hospital which had opened after months, in Boisar, showed that he would need another surgery costing Rs 1 lakh, which was too expensive. Finally, in the last week of June, he found a private hospital in Dahanu which agreed to perform the surgery for a smaller amount. Even for that, he had to borrow money. An employee in a private firm in Boisar, he has not been paid his salary since March.",
    "In the face of the staggering hardships of migrants, and the overall grim picture of healthcare during the ",
    "pandemic",
    ", this is not an unusual or even a dramatic story anymore. The people here leave healthcare to fate: If you are meant to die, you will. Travelling 150- odd km to Mumbai for public hospitals is something they rarely take a chance on, and the travel cost itself is prohibitive for many of them. Hardly anyone knows about the government health schemes and there is no one to explain things to them either. Many of the Warli Adivasis still prefer to have their children at home, while some have made it to the local sub-district hospital in recent times.",
    "Though this area is close to Mumbai, these people do not have piped water or sanitation. People make a quick buck on mining water, and it is one of the ways of earning money. Healthcare is a low priority and that is why quacks abound, who make a successful living with their fake injections.",
    "COVID-19 only exacerbated the problems of the abysmal healthcare infrastructure in the cities and rural areas. The emphasis on private healthcare has backfired in more ways than one. Most of the private hospitals have shut down since March in places like Palghar and Boisar and one of the few places that was open was the homoeopathic hospital run by the M L Dhawale Trust in Palghar. Suddenly, there was a flood of patients in the hospital, which scrambled around to raise funds to treat the hundreds of people who lined up for relief from non-COVID illnesses. Since it was run by a charitable trust, with a long and respectable tradition of healthcare, it could not be ruthless and turn away patients as the other hospitals did.",
    "Some years ago, reporting on public hearings under the National Rural Health Mission, as part of an effort by the NGO Saathi and Nitin Jadhav, a doctor, and I visited the Saywan primary health centre (PHC) and other places in the Thane district. The PHC was leaking, there was water everywhere. The two toilets in the sub-district hospital in Shahpur were used as storerooms. A pregnant woman who had to walk a distance to reach another toilet, delivered en route and had to be rushed to a hospital to Thane city, three hours away. Radiologists and doctors are hard to come by even after the bifurcation of Thane into two districts, Palghar being the other one. In Shahpur, at one point a woman had to wait for the third Wednesday of each month for a sonography. The basic point is that despite all the grand government schemes, many of them involving much paperwork and red tape which can be a nightmare even for literate people, there is no universal healthcare worth the name in this country.
