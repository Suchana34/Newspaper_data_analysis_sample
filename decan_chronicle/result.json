    "The US Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programmes that are fully online for the fall semester nor will US Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States, the release said referring to the September to December semester.",
    "The agency suggested that students currently enrolled in the US consider other measures, like transferring to schools with in-person instruction.",
    "International students enrolled in academic programmes at US universities and colleges study on an F-1 visa and those enrolled in technical programmes at vocational or other recognised non-academic institutions, other than a language training programme come to the US on an M-1 visa.",

    "It further said that students attending schools adopting a hybrid model, which includes a mixture of online and in-person classes, will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online.",
    "These schools must certify to the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme that the course is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree programme.",
    "The guidance is certain to cause severe anxiety and uncertainty for the hundreds of thousands of international students who are studying in the country and for those who were preparing to arrive in the US to begin their education when the new academic session begins in September.",
    "International travel restrictions in place due to the pandemic have made it increasingly difficult for foreign students in the US to return to their home countries, while those outside America are uncertain if they will be able to travel to join their courses in American colleges and universities.",
    "The Trump administration has made a number of changes to the US immigration system, citing the coronavirus pandemic.",
    "On June 22, it issued a proclamation, dramatically curtailing legal immigration to the US till December 31. Under this, people with L-1, H-1B, H-2B and J-1 visas were affected."

    "In the fight to halt the coronavirus, several countries have been touted as models to be emulated. Chiefly, South Korea is oft cited, justifiably so. However, no country has met with as much success in holding off and beating back the virus as Taiwan, whose geographical and cultural proximity, literally next door, to China makes the feat all the more remarkable. Contained in this narrative are valuable insights for other countries such as India that are still in the throes of this pandemic.",
    "Situated a mere 130 km off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan has 850,000 to 1 million citizens who live or work in China. Although Beijing and Taipei are adversarial regimes, numerous daily flights link the island to multiple major cities in China. Given such proximity, Taiwan would likely be the most affected by any epidemic with origins in China. In fact, it was the hardest hit when SARS broke out in China in 2003. Taiwan then had the highest mortality rate in the world.",
    " ",
    "That did not happen this time.",
    "Taiwan's Covid-19 numbers have been surprisingly low, for a country that has 2.7 million visitors from the mainland annually and almost 12,000 daily just before the Lunar New Year. As of May 12, Taiwan has 440 total coronavirus cases, of which 372 have already been cured. There have been only 7 deaths. With less than 100 active cases, Taiwan has halted the virus at its doorstep. It managed all this in spite of not being a member of the WHO and while organising a national election on January 11.",
    "How was this possible?",
    "Led by Experts",
    "Remarkably, Taiwan’s strategy to combat the novel coronavirus nCoV19 was led by experts and scientists who responded with urgency to the initial outbreak in China. Taiwan’s vice-president, Chen Chien-jen is a Johns Hopkins University trained epidemiologist, public health expert and national hero for his role as health minister during the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Similarly, vice-premier Chen Chi-mai is a physician by training and former lecturer who collaborated with Minister for health and welfare Chen Shih-chung, a doctor and former director of Taipei Medical University. According to Channel News Asia (CNA), at 8 A.M on December 31, the latter was informed of at least seven atypical cases of pneumonia in Wuhan. Within an hour an inter-ministerial meeting was held to determine the measures to be taken to tackle the virus. ",
    "This response was as agile as the response in Wuhan itself. Over the next few days, suspected-case reporting and hospital infection control measures were strengthened, a level-1 travel notice to Wuhan was announced, and by January 15 all hospitals and the public were notified about the emerging infectious disease. By January 20, Taiwan activated the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) to coordinate and lead the response to the virus. Daily briefings to the public conducted by health minister Chen Shih-chung, attended by nearly 100,000 people, were also important in keeping the public informed and aware. The health minister currently enjoys an approval rating of 91% in Taiwan and has become the country’s most popular politician, even more than President Tsai ing-wen.",
    "Flight Screening and Border Controls",
    "Allowing public health experts to direct the response to Covid-19 meant that Taiwan could make a crucial connection very very early: that air travel was the main pathway of virus transmission. So, Taipei acted quickly to restrict and monitor air travel.",
    "On December 31, the very day China reported the outbreak to the WHO, Taiwan began sending healthcare officials into airplanes to check passengers arriving from Wuhan before they disembarked. Within a couple of days, these measures were expanded to include fever screening and full-scale medical examination of suspected cases. Within 10 days after the flareup of the mysterious new virus in Wuhan on January 21, Taiwan closed its borders to all Wuhan residents, and by 6 Feb extended the restrictions to all arrivals from China, six days before any other country did so. Taiwan also issued a ban on all port calls by international cruise ships on Feb 6, to prevent more cases like the Diamond Princess. To monitor all foreign arrivals into the country, passengers were required to sign and complete a health declaration form. As the virus began to spread outside China to places like Thailand and Singapore, travel advisories were issued to these places by February 11. By early March, all foreign arrivals without a residence permit were banned from entering the country.",
    "By strange coincidence or premonition, nearly a fortnight before December 31,",
    "\r\non December 18, 2019, in fact, an awards ceremony was held in Taiwan for airlines with outstanding performance in disease surveillance and aviation safety. At the same event, Taiwan CDC, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced their joint collaboration in implementing the Program for Airlines on Disease Prevention, Preparedness and Response, and Emergency Management, the first of its kind in the world. ",
    "Central Command Coordinated Measures",
    "Activated on January 20, the Central Epidemic Command Centre proceeded to implement a total of ",
    "124 measures",
    " so far, including but not limited to border controls and fever screenings. One of the most significant of these was, contrary to WHO advice, a ban on the export of face masks and a decision to increase the production of protective equipment. The ban came into effect on Jan 24, one month before any other country adopted the same measure. According to the Vice-President, by the end of January, Taiwan stockpiled 44 million surgical masks, 1.95 million N-95 masks and 1,100 negative pressure isolation rooms. A national mask team was set up and 92 additional production lines were installed and the government requisitioned a total of 73 manufacturing companies. The policy increased the average daily production of masks from 1.9 million in January to 16 million masks daily in April. The CECC also instituted a rationing system for masks, according to which every citizen could buy 3 masks per week, then raised to 9 every fortnight, and finally an online ordering system was instituted.",
    "Taiwan’s lightning-quick reaction has undoubtedly saved hundreds of lives and prevented thousands more from becoming infected. The island managed this without ever announcing a lockdown and significantly disrupting domestic economic and social life. Taiwan is also able to avoid, to a certain extent, the economic slump that follows a lockdown. Agencies like S&P and other economists have revised Taiwan’s GDP for 2020, but by a smaller margin than any other industrialised country. Schools, offices, restaurants and malls have remained open through the outbreak, limiting the disruption to the economy. Additionally, the island’s approach of involving the public in the fight against Covid-19 has the additional benefit of inculcating awareness in its public, making a transition to the new normal much smoother. With just 65 active cases left, Taiwan has turned its attention to other countries struggling to contain the virus, with the campaign TaiwanCanHelp, which donates masks and other resources.",
    "Most of Taiwan’s measures to combat Covid-19 were announced in late January and early February, taking effect almost immediately. The credit for this accrues to experts and scientists holding political office, who lead the fight against Covid-19, calling the shots and responding to developments in China almost instantaneously. The promptness in enacting these measures has been shown by no other country. While some countries like India were busy hosting grand bilateral summits for foreign leaders and others like USA were turning the virus into a political weapon, Taiwan was preparing for the Covid-19 outbreak, which has held the country in good stead in the months following the initial stages of the outbreak."

    "The role of technology in helping push back against the novel coronavirus has been hailed widely. But it also means that people are constantly being watched by entities that can set the tone for public behaviour without giving a shred of consideration to people’s privacy. One of the greatest contemporary thinkers, Noam Chomsky, warns of the consequences of technology being allowed to control our lives in the guise of making our lives easier.",
    "In an interview with AFP, Chomsky talked about how the dystopian reality of digital surveillance is already here.  “There are now companies developing technology which make it possible for the employer ... to look at what's on your computer screen and to check your keystrokes and if you get up and walk away for a minute, they'll send you a warning.”",
    " ",
    "“That's being installed right now.... It's not the future.”",
    "The very things that are convenient are the ones that are invasive, he pointed out. “The so-called Internet of Things is coming along. It's convenient. It means if you're driving home you can turn on the stove — but it also means that that information is going to Google and Facebook, to the government, the American government, the French government, it's an enormous amount of potential control, surveillance and invasion. But this has happened. It's not the future.",
    "“If we allow the huge tech companies, the state, to control our life that's what will happen. They'll turn it into something like China, where you have social credit systems and in some cities you get a certain amount of credits, there's face recognition technology all over the place and everything you do gets monitored.",
    "“If you cross the street in the wrong place, you can ... lose some credits, and so on.",
    "“It's not inevitable, just like global warming, that it's going to happen — unless people stop it.”",
    "When asked whether the use of surveillance was justified in combating COVID-19, said “It might be — during the period of threat. There's controls needed during wartime, you have rationing. But it doesn't have to be permanent.... 'Yes, we'll let you have this authority now, but it can be revoked at any time.'\"",
    "Speaking about other major problems facing humankind, Chomsky said global warming was a greater threat than even the deadly pandemic. . “As severe as this pandemic is, it's not the worst problem. There will be recovery from the pandemic at severe cost ... but there isn't going to be any recovery from the melting of the polar ice caps and the rising of sea levels and the other deleterious effects of global warming,” he said.",
    "However, it is evident that the public is either not aware or not bothered to see global warming as a serious enough problem.  ",
    "That kind of a public in the US also voted for a leadership that has proven itself wholly unequal to the task of managing the pandemic in the country where more than 100,000 people have died of it . “There's no coherent leadership. It's chaotic. The presidency, the White House, is in the hands of a sociopathic megalomaniac who's interested in nothing but his own power, electoral prospects — doesn't care what happens to the country, the world,” Chomsky said, in scathing criticism of President Donald Trump.",
    "Chomsky spelled out how the administration under Trump never even gave the US a chance against COVID-19. “As soon as Trump came in, his first move was to dismantle the entire pandemic prevention machinery. At the start, defunding the Center for Disease Control, which would deal with this. And canceling programs that were working with Chinese scientists to identify potential viruses. So the US was singularly unprepared,” Chomsky said.",
    "He explained the economic model that led to the current situation. “It's a privatised society, very wealthy, with enormous advantages — far more than any other country — but it’s in the stranglehold of private control.",
    "“It doesn't have a universal health care system.... It's the ultimate neoliberal system, actually.”",
    "He compared it to Europe, which in “many ways is worse, because the austerity programs just amplify the danger, because of the severe attack on democracy in Europe, the shifting decisions to Brussels....” But he added, “At least it has the residue of some kind of social democratic structure, which provides some support, which is what I think is lacking in the US.”",

    "Weeks after Mukesh Ambani signed a deal between JioMart and Facebook, the self-declared kirana store aggregator has launched its services in 200 cities, including small cities such as Bhatinda, Mysuru and Dehradun, but without taking the neighbourhood stores on board.",
    "A pilot project launched last month in Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan, all suburbs of Mumbai, included kirana stores as well as JioMart’s own warehouses; but now with the national launch, the kirana stores are nowhere in the picture at present.",
    " ",
    "Currently, grocery orders placed on the JioMart website are serviced by Reliance Smart and Fresh stores and Reliance Retail’s Sahakari Bhandar stores, not neighbourhood shops, PTI quoted the financial services company Credit Suisse as saying.",
    "“Just prior to the national launch, Reliance Retail tapped the WhatsApp customer base in the three pilot regions to source orders. In our view, it was just a test phase of integration,” it said.",
    "\"The orders were available only for pick-up from nearby kirana stores, whose details were sent to the customer via WhatsApp. However, the national launch, so far, does not have that integration with WhatsApp.”",
    "While JioMart claims it will be adding kirana stores shortly on its platform, the question arises whether this is just a test phase to see whether customers will flock to JioMart abandoning their neighbourhood stores.",
    "Even if that is not the case or in the event that the test is not successful and the kirana stores just have to be brought on board, Reliance could use them as mere delivery mules, insisting that the stores stock what Reliance supplies, at the rate it decides.",
    "In an indication of that, Credit Suisse said, “In terms of pricing, Reliance has extended the Smart promise of ‘minimum 5 per cent off on MRP’ to all products on JioMart. The discount is higher on its private label brands, and is competitive to branded products.”",
    "So, if it looks like the kirana store aggregator model of JioMart is morphing into a takeover of the grocery market itself, it could very well be the case. Market research firm Bernstein says groceries make up 70 per cent of the Indian retail market, with more than 90 per cent driven by neighbourhood shops. “Organised penetration is less than 10 per cent while online penetration is less than 1 per cent,” it said.",
    "So Reliance’s likely ambition to replace mom and pop stores is pretty much in keeping with what seems to be its monopolistic vision. Case in point, the telecom industry, where Reliance’s free offers and low prices managed to make it the dominant force in a field that earlier had several players.",
    "As things stand, supermarket chain D-Mart’s April revenues are down 45 per cent year-on-year, with nearly 50 per cent of its stores shut or having restricted hours of operation. D-Mart is just one example among a vast space being vacated by similar businesses in the grocery market.",
    "These falling revenues are what Reliance aims to mop up with the JioMart network.",
    "“...a pan-India extension of partnerships with mom and pop stores after a successful beta test and ramp-up of this new commerce venture is crucial in Reliance’s grand plan of converting Jio’s 400 million-plus subscribers into customers for its ecommerce and other offerings,” market investment and insights firm CLSA was quoted as saying by PTI.",
    "As such, Reliance’s recent partnership with Facebook-owned WhatsApp for JioMart is aimed at converting Jio subscribers into JioMart shoppers.",
    "Eventually, like other online retailers, Reliance could integrate its entire retail offerings, including fashion, lifestyle and consumer electronics, onto one super ecommerce platform and mobile app, rivalling Amazon and Flipkart.",
    "Bernstein in a separate report said as much: “JioMart has seen a 4x rise in online orders from a low base. With its pan India presence, JioMart now directly competes with Amazon and Flipkart in eCommerce.”",

    "There could not have been anything more ironical than the frailty of human beings staring us in the face in a world characterised by the rising number of populists. For several years we have seen the emergence of leaders across the world, including all around us, who professed to be in ready possession of quick solutions to deep-rooted, enigmatic and complex problems. Yet, as the events since December 2019, but more so in recent weeks, have shown us, magic wands are good solely to lay a smooth pathway to governance or to the office of power, but rarely thereafter.",
    "What, however, compounds the paradox is that people, when faced with the old tossup  -- what manages crises better, authoritarian or democratic systems -- might conclude that it is best to follow the pied pipers merely because such blind following spares them having to take responsibility, for  themselves and others. Responsibility -- political, economic and social -- is paramount and must be primary in times of pandemics and other similar challenging circumstances, yet it is a burden that few are willing to take and more shirk.",
    " ",
    "If the initially comatose response of governments in the United States and several European countries are anything to go by, and juxtapose it with the way that China went about its “business”, it certainly strengthened the viewpoint that these challenges are best met by governments that “do” and don’t “debate or deliberate”. But how does one characterise the Indian government's initial lethargy and belief that the coronavirus would “go” by deputing Union ministers to chant mantras and outsourcing a few yagnas to ideological affiliates? This is, after all, a strong-willed and clear-thinking government -- at least that is the yarn the PR machinery has spun -- so why this belated action?",
    "Panic trigger",
    "Even this response or action has unfortunately ended up elevating panic instead of pacifying people. Furthermore, the entire thrust has appeared uni-dimensional rather than following a multi-faceted approach that does not look at the challenge merely from the prism of health facilities and containment. Societies like India have abysmal levels of welfare systems and the disparity levels remain glaringly high.",
    "Human crises, especially those that spare no one in the community, get accentuated by fear, suspicion, distrust and hatred. No leader in India, either in the government or outside, has either targeted any of these failings, or cautioned people to be on their guard against such divisive sentiments. Not just in India, but elsewhere in the world too has in recent times, selfish leaders have built political embankments by playing on the anxieties of one group, or by publicising the myth that goodies have so far been earmarked for the imaginary “other”. Large sections of Indians have been seeing this for the past several months, especially since the middle of 2019 following the watershed electoral verdict, as many of their dystopian imaginations are coming true.",
    "Few people expected that there was more to come from completely unexpected frontiers. For a large section of Indians, the triumphalist script was running to perfection. The last vestiges of the coalition era had been shed, and there was greater ideological cohesion in a decisive government led by an infallible leader who brooked nothing that was against the “national interest”. Even Pakistan had been marginalised internationally, and its protestations on Kashmir had evoked a feeble response. That is why the threat from the coronavirus was presumed to be somebody else’s problem.",
    "The still underway debate over the past few days if a group of a few hundred people, predominantly elderly women protesting against the amended citizenship law, had the capacity to significantly elevate the threat of coronavirus has been farcical. The campaign deriding the sit-ins against the CAA was politically motivated and paradoxical amid the continuance of Parliament’s Budget Session merely as cutting it short would strengthen the Madhya Pradesh Speaker’s case, who had chosen to push back the floor test in the state Assembly in the hope that this would provide the Kamal Nath government an opportunity to remain in office by handing out a bigger lure. Like always, this is a case of misplaced priorities. Sadly, it stems from possible non-recognition of the scale of the affliction.",
    "Hardships under curfew",
    "As a reporter, for decades one has been privy to hardships faced by people under curfew because people fought one another for their own gods only. This time it is possibly not a temporary lockdown, and people are forced to flee cities and towns where they found work and return to their villages. No migrant worker wishes to die without his family at his side, with all fear becoming a part of the “missing” list, fates that often await less-privileged people. Indians without cushions find their present stolen and a secure future is not in sight.",
    "Hardships and common concerns are expected to bring people together on same platforms. But urban India has already seen suspicion eat into social relationships. Neighbours give a cold stare to a person coughing and the police is often called to hustle even non-carriers of the virus to quarantines. Religious institutions too, who are also home to the destitute, are shutting their doors and await normal “business”. Instead of providing alternate platforms for the needy, the state will possibly utilise this as opportunity to widen the infrastructure of surveillance, ostensibly for the people’s good.",
    "Containment of the disease certainly has to be priority. The need to ramp up health facilities overnight is obvious, however herculean a task this may be. But, in the effort to protect the more visible, invisible Indians cannot be forsaken like they were during the self-induced catastrophe of demonetisation. Social distancing may become the OED’s word of the year, but many Indians know since birth the need to maintain distance and what exclusion means. The panic shutdown of work spaces across industries and sectors without providing safeguards is being accepted by people at the moment, as they take flight from possible infection. But it is a matter of time before hunger begins gnawing the insides and weakens the body and mind further. The response of the Indian government so far shows little evidence of an emerging comprehensive plan."

    "India is going into the longest lockdown in the world, with the least amount of notice given to its people and the least preparation by its government. Many states want the lockdown to be extended to the end of April, and it is possible that much if not most of India will continue the freeze.",
    "What was the point of the lockdown? We were not told this explicitly by the Prime Minister; but globally it is understood to serve two purposes. The first is that it is time that is used for the state to build its capacity, especially for adding ventilators and intensive care units (ICUs). The second reason is that a lockdown slows the spread of the virus. The virus incubates in those it has infected and they can be identified and isolated. Has India’s lockdown been useful from these two points of view?",
    " ",
    "The answer to the first is that we have not used this time to build capacity. A report in the Hindu on Saturday, April 11, said that: “A countrywide shortage of medicines and medical devices is likely in the coming weeks, the department of pharmaceuticals has warned the home ministry, urging it to take immediate steps to help drug makers resume production under the current lockdown. Drug and medical device makers are functioning …on an average, at only 20-30 per cent capacity during the lockdown,” as per feedback from various industry formations. Department of pharmaceuticals secretary P.D. Vaghela pointed out in an April 9 communique to home secretary Ajay Bhalla, “It was not clear why the government did not put special effort into ensuring that this production continued to at least function if not increase in scale.”",
    "Another report said that at a meeting of government officials it was revealed that possibly half of India’s existing 40,000 ventilators were not working because of a lack of spare parts. A third report in the Economic Times on March 24 said that ventilator manufacturers were crippled by the lockdown and unable to produce the machines. All in all, we can assume that the government has not been able to use this time of the lockdown to build capacity.",
    "The second reason for the shutdown is to slow the spread of the virus. Have we been successful in this? The lockdown was announced when we had about 500 cases, today we have over 7,000. We added 1,000 cases in the last 24 hours alone and the escalation of the spread is constant except in one state (Kerala), where the spread is slower. That could be interpreted as success or failure, but the real position is that we do not know if the spread has slowed or become faster and that is because we are not testing many people. India has among the lowest testing rates of any country. We finished testing a little over a lakh people on Friday. Germany, which has a population that is 15 times smaller than India’s, had tested over 13 lakh people in the same period. Another indicator that our testing is off is the fatality rate, which is 10 times higher in Madhya Pradesh than in Kerala, according to a Times of India report on Saturday. This means that it’s likely there are people dying untested, having spread the infection before passing away.",
    "I am aware that there are several reasons for the lack of widespread testing in India including the fact that we are a poor nation that has not given much attention to healthcare and doesn’t have the sort of money to spend on testing as Germany. But that is not the point here. We are trying to ascertain whether or not the lockdown has been used in the way that logic demanded that it be used.",
    "There should have been a purpose and a goal in putting crores of India through the sort of trauma that they are going through in these days. There should have been a reason to deliberately cripple the economy as we have done and to my mind the two reasons have not been fulfilled.",
    "What other purpose has the lockdown served? We are not sure. Rioting happened in Surat this week by migrant labourers stuck there and demanding to go home, and reports of the deaths of migrants stuck with no options and no assistance are common. All of it points to a lack of planning, strategy and execution. This is bad governance by definition.",
    "But that hasn’t stopped the politics as usual from continuing. Writing in Business Standard on Saturday, T.N. Ninan said: “The Covid-19 epidemic has come just in time to save the first year of Narendra Modi’s second term… growth of the non-government part of the economy had been reduced to just over three per cent in two quarters till December. Politically, Mr Modi had walked into a cul-de-sac with his amended citizenship law, which sparked extended protest sit-ins by citizens, provoked firm push-backs from state governments and state assemblies, and risked the decennial Census. How the narrative has changed in a few weeks!”",
    "“The protesters against the citizenship law have dispersed, state governments are queuing up for desperately-needed financial support, and all economic problems can be laid safely at the door of Covid-19. The Prime Minister, not seen in Parliament during some key debates, is now on national television every few days with avuncular homilies while imposing a lockdown without notice, demonetisation style.” He concludes, “meanwhile, the further marginalising of Muslims has also developed into a Jan Andolan”."

    "The economic cost of the Covid-19 pandemic is going to be huge. A shutdown for a month literally means a hole of at least 8.5 per cent in the annual output. Consumption (C), which accounts for almost 63 per cent of GDP, is not likely to recover to that level, for this year at least. The view among most economists is that the annual GDP growth is likely to be about 0.5 per cent or less. This implies that annual consumption will decrease by about 6-8 per cent. Many others think the decline in consumption will be much greater and growth could be sub-zero How soon consumption recovers depends on how soon the lockdown ends and how soon jobs are restored.",
    "The United States intends to pump $2 trillion, or about 10 per cent of its GDP, into its economy. Britain and France intend to pour in about 5 per cent of their GDPs, while Japan is injecting $1 trillion, or a huge 20 per cent of GDP. Our government’s economic revival package of Rs 1.7 lakh crore is about 0.6 per cent of GDP. Even within it, a third of it is money already collected as a cess for the express purpose of aiding construction labour and left unused for years. So, Narendra Modi’s revival package is no more than 0.4 per cent of GDP. We clearly need to do much better.",
    " ",
    "The collapse of consumption will not only result in a commensurate contraction of manufacturing, but will also choke the system with huge unsold inventories. Resuming manufacturing to even near old levels will take longer due to supply lines being disrupted. The automotive sector, which accounts for 7.5 per cent of GDP or about half of all manufacturing, will take longer to revive as consumer confidence has shrunk. The recovery of manufacturing depends on how soon this sector revives. The incidence of automotive taxes ranges from 29 per cent to 46 per cent of end prices. To get the unsold stock moving, the government can consider a deep slash of GST for a limited time to get customers rushing back into the showrooms with their chequebooks.",
    "But most damaging of all is the loss of jobs. India has a labour force of about 495 million. Santosh Mehrotra, professor of economics at JNU, co-authored a paper with Jajati K. Parida pegging the share of the informal sector at 90.7 per cent overall and 83.5 per cent in the non-farm sectors. Using NSS and PLFS data, they estimated that 260 million people are employed in India’s non-farm sector and 205 million in agriculture. Thus, the number of informal workers totals about 217 million across the services, manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors.",
    "The paper further suggests that about 136 million workers in India, or over half the total workers in non-agricultural sectors, have no contracts and remain the most vulnerable in the aftermath of the lockdown. They are almost all daily wagers. The latest CMIE report estimates unemployment in this sector to be a little over 30 per cent, or anywhere between 4-50 million rendered wageless. Daily wages are just about enough to meet the most basic daily food requirements of a typical poor household. ",
    "So what can prime minister Modi do now to get us out of this quagmire? As it is, he is hamstrung by a weak economic management team with novices as two key players, the finance minister and RBI governor. Even if he addresses this, where will the money come from?",
    "India has over $480 billion nesting abroad earning ridiculously low interest. Even if a tenth of this is monetized for injection into the national economy, it will mean more than Rs 3.2 lakh crore. At last count the RBI had about Rs 9.6 lakh crore as reserves. This is money to be used in a financial emergency. We are now in an emergency like we have never encountered or foresaw before. Even a third of this, or about Rs 3.2 lakh crore, is about twice the present plan. ",
    "There are other sources of funds too, but tapping these entails political courage and sacrifices. Our cumulative government wages and pension bill amounts to about 11.4 per cent of GDP. After exempting the military and paramilitary, which is mostly under active deployment, we can target 1 per cent of GDP just by cancelling annual leave and LTC, and rolling DA by the last two or three increases. The government can also sequester a fixed percentage from bank deposits, say 5 per cent of deposits between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 100 lakh and 15-20 per cent from bigger deposits for tax-free interest-bearing bonds in exchange. The 10 top private companies alone have cash reserves of over Rs 10 lakh crore. There is money in the trees, and all it needs is a good shakeup to pick the fruits. The pain of the lockdown must not be borne by the poor alone. The government can easily target 5 per cent of GDP for the recovery fund as an achievable goal. The fiscal deficit goals can wait.",
    "This money can be used to immediately begin a Universal Basic Income scheme, by transferring a sum of Rs 5,000 monthly into the Jan Dhan accounts for the duration of the financial emergency; fund GST concessions; begin emergency rural reconstruction projects to generate millions of new jobs and get our core infrastructure sectors like steel, cement and transportation moving again.",
    "The lockdown cannot be an indefinite exercise. We need to progressively lift it so that the economic costs do not overwhelm us. Remember, the case fatality of Covid-19 is about 1 per cent, meaning it is not much worse than our usual seasonal influenzas. Its rapid spread is what makes it dangerous as it might overwhelm our medical care system.",
    "The data available now makes it explicit that the Covid-19 virus is dangerous mostly to the physically weak and vulnerable. Over 63 per cent of those afflicted with visible symptoms are 60-plus. Clearly, we need to insulate senior citizens and children from infection. The lockdown can be targeted to protect them. Thus, while high schools, colleges and industrial workplaces can be opened, primary and middle schools can be shut for longer. We should also keep all places of social and religious gatherings like restaurants, cinemas, temples, mosques, churches, wedding/function halls etc closed for now.",
    "The time has come to make tough decisions. Just clanging thalis and lighting diyas will not do."

    "EDWARD COLSTON — The toppling of a statue of the 17th-century slave trader in the port city of Bristol on Sunday reignited debate in Britain about who deserves a permanent public memorial. Colston built a fortune transporting more than 80,000 enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean before leaving his money to charity. His name adorns streets and buildings in Bristol, which was once the U.K.’s biggest port for slave ships. The statue has been pulled out of the harbour where protesters dumped it and will be placed in a museum.",
    "CECIL RHODES -- The Victorian imperialist served as prime minister of the Cape Colony in southern Africa and made a fortune from gold and diamond mines where miners laboured in brutal conditions. He was an education benefactor whose legacy includes Oxford University’s Rhodes scholarships for international students. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015 after students led a “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign. A similar campaign is seeking to remove a statue of Rhodes from Oxford’s Oriel College.",
    "HENRY DUNDAS -- The late 18th-century Scottish politician was responsible for delaying Britain’s abolition of the slave trade by 15 years until 1807. During that time, more than half a million enslaved Africans were trafficked across the Atlantic. Campaigners want his statue removed from atop its column in Edinburgh’s St. Andrew Square. There are also calls to rename Dundas Street, a major thoroughfare in the Canadian city of Toronto.",
    "ROBERT MILLIGAN -- Authorities in London this week removed a statue of Milligan, an 18th-century merchant, who owned two sugar plantations in Jamaica with more than 500 slaves, from its perch in the city’s docklands.",
    "ROBERT BADEN-POWELL — Officials plan to remove a statue of the founder of the Scouts movement from the quayside in Poole, southern England, out of concern it may be a target for protesters. Like many Englishmen of his time, Baden-Powell held racist views. He also expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler.",
    "Authorities in London and many other U.K. cities have announced plans to review all statues, street names and other monuments to see whether they reflect modern values and the country’s current diversity. This is sure to lead to fiery debate. Some have called for the removal of statues of WILLIAM GLADSTONE, the reforming 19th-century prime minister whose father was one of the biggest slave-owners in the British West Indies. Gladstone defended slave owners and sought compensation for them when slavery was abolished.",
    "Even national hero WINSTON CHURCHILL is a contentious figure. Britain’s wartime prime minister is revered by many in the U.K. as the man who led the country to victory against Nazi Germany. But he was also a staunch defender of the British Empire and expressed racist views.",

    "Several statues have been placed under police protection in France amid protests against monuments to historical figures with links to the country’s colonial past and slavery.",
    "JEAN-BAPTISTE COLBERT — Last week, police blocked protesters in Paris from reaching a statue of Colbert in front of the National Assembly, the lower house of the French parliament. The 17th-century politician, a prominent minister under King Louis XIV, drafted the “Code Noir” (“Black Code”), which regulated the conditions of slavery in French overseas colonies.",
    "JOSEPH GALLIENI — Police in Paris also guarded a statue of French military commander Gallieni. He used brutal methods to quell rebellion of local populations in French colonies. As a late 19th-century governor of Madagascar, he abolished the 350-year-old monarchy on the island.",
    "VICTOR SCHOELCHER — Even before George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, protesters on the French island of Martinique toppled two statues of 19th-century politician Schoelcher on May 22, the anniversary of the abolition of slavery on the Caribbean island. Schoelcher prepared and wrote the 1848 decree abolishing slavery in France’s colonies. But protesters denounced his colonialist views and argued local abolitionists more worthy of honouring. French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the statues’ removal, tweeting last month that Schoelcher “has made France great” by abolishing slavery.",

In Madrid, a central square named for him features a prominent Columbus statue surrounded by traffic.",

Last year, the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez succeeded in removing Franco’s body from a glorifying mausoleum on the outskirts of Madrid where his remains had laid for more than four decades. The remains were moved to a family chapel in a small public cemetery and have not become a focus of right-wing pilgrimages, as some had feared.",

Montanelli, who inspired a generation of Italian reporters, admitted in the late 1960s that he had a 12-year-old Ethiopian bride when he was a soldier during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia. He justified his action by saying it was the local custom. The statue, in a Milan park that bears Montanelli’s name, was mentioned during a weekend Black Lives Matter protest, and an anti-fascist group called the Sentinels of Milan has called for its removal.",

    "KING LEOPOLD II — The Belgian monarch who ruled Belgium from 1865 to 1909 held Congo as his personal fiefdom, forcing many of its people into slavery to extract resources for his personal profit. His early rule, starting in 1885, was famous for its brutality, which some experts say left as many as 10 million of Congo’s people dead. Statues of Leopold dot towns and cities across Belgium, but a growing movement wants him removed from public view. Statues of Leopold have been defaced in half a dozen cities in the past week. In Antwerp, authorities removed a statue that had been burned and splattered with red paint. It is unclear whether it will be re-erected.",

    "JAN PIETERSZOON COEN -- A statue of the Dutch Golden Age trader and brutal colonialist in his hometown of Hoorn, north of Amsterdam, has been the subject of debate for years. Coen was a leading figure in the Dutch East India Company, a 17th-century trading powerhouse, and is credited with founding Batavia, the city now known as Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta. But he also has gone down in history as the “butcher of Banda,” the man who ordered a bloody massacre on the Banda Islands in what is now Indonesia as a way of cornering the lucrative market for nutmeg and mace.",
    "A plaque on the statue highlights both sides of his story. The text says Coen was “praised as a vigorous and visionary administrator,” but was also “criticized for the violent means by which he built up trade monopolies in the East Indies.” In 2012, the Westfries Museum that overlooks the statue held an exhibition dedicated to Coen, asking visitors to decide whether the statue should stay or go. Two-thirds of the 3,500 visitor votes were in favor of the statue staying.",
    "Museum director Ad Geerdink said if Hoon political leaders decide to take down the statue, the Westfries would be happy to place it in its garden “not to honour Coen, but to put it into context.”"

De Klerk, on the other hand, came out smelling or roses for having renounced power. In truth, what decided their fate was the global situation. At the Cold War’s end, a nasty, nuclear-armed white outpost in the face of rising black anger had become unnecessary. The odium of apartheid could now be shed.",

The 2008 financial crisis, and the huge slump after the Covid-19 mayhem, have induced some rethink. Comprehensive healthcare for all, universal basic income, a review of the Scandinavian model, are all part of a vigorous discourse in the West. There is, on the other hand, a deafening silence on these issues in India, where millions of the hungry and destitute sent on a trek may well return to plague us."

    "I was sitting with a guest, a saintly person from Tral, in our living room, chatting about the unending mayhem in Kashmir, and how it was ruining more and more lives across the valley with each passing day.",
    "My wife and eldest daughter Umme Kulthum were busy in the kitchen and then preparing the dastarkhwan for meals in the distinctive Kashmiri way in the adjoining lounge.",
    " ",
    "My youngest daughter Fatima Zahra interrupted us to announce ‘Dinner is ready’.",
    "Her elder sister Zainab brought ‘Tasht-Naari’, a pair of copper appliances with beautiful engravings of chinars and their entangled vines, traditionally used to wash hands before meals.",
    "Suddenly there was the sound of gunfire outside and everyone got rattled. Lights were switched off in every house. We huddled inside a small room with only one window opening to the rear on the first floor.",
    "As the firing intensified, Zainab started crying and my wife and I began narrating some of the experiences we had endured during the heyday of militancy in the 1990s and how we survived even in the worst situations in order to reassure her. We also emphasised \"nothing can happen without God's will\".",
    "Fatima asked, \"Okay we will not die before our time but what if our house is bombed or torched?”",
    "She had in mind the destruction of a whole cluster of residential houses during a fire fight in the Nawa Kadal neighbourhood in Srinagar on May 19. The security forces had termed that damage as inevitable collateral damage but local people accused them of deliberately destroying the neighbourhood which rendered many families homeless.",
    "I tried to comfort my daughter. “Nothing of that sort will happen here. It seems as if the militants are holed up in a house far away from ours.”",
    "After the firing stopped, I started receiving phone calls from neighbours, relatives and friends -- some wanting to know what had happened and others inquiring about our well-being. Social media accounts were already reporting the “encounter” between the militants and security forces in our locality. A tweet from the Jammu & Kashmir police confirmed the gunfight. It said, “Encounter has started at #Malbagh area of #Srinagar. Police and security forces on the job. Further details shall follow.”",
    "Since the firing had ceased, I told my wife and children and our guest that they should prepare themselves for a resumption of fighting, more intensely, at first light. Normally, security forces suspend operations for the night to avoid casualties.",
    "But by quarter past midnight, we came to know that the ‘encounter is over’. The J&K police reported the death of one militant and one CRPF jawan in the clash.  It also claimed that it was a smooth operation during which no collateral damage had taken place. I looked at Zainab. She was still frightened. Umme Kulthum and Fatima sat silently, frightened nevertheless. My wife was in conversation with her sister who too lives in Srinagar over the phone to tell her ‘Khodayan bachaiv (God saved us)’.  ",
    "On Friday morning, word spread in our neighbourhood that it had been a fake encounter. A resident claimed that the security forces entered the house of his neigbour after climbing over the compound wall and searched the premises. After coming out, he shot dead someone at point blank outside on the street. But how was the CRPF jawan (identified as head-constable Kuldeep Kumar) killed then? He had no answer to offer nor did the others who insist it was a “fake encounter”.",
    "The J&K police said the operation was launched jointly by it and the 118th Battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force after receiving “credible inputs” about the presence of militants in the area. “During the search operation, the hiding terrorists fired on the joint search party. The fire was retaliated, leading to an encounter in which one terrorist was killed,” the police statement said.",
    "The police identified the slain youth as Zahid Ahmed Dassm, a member of Islamic State Jammu Kashmir (ISJK) who, it claimed, was involved in a series of terror crimes including the June 26 sneak attack in which a CRPF jawan and a six-year-old boy were killed in the Padshahi Bagh area of Bijbehara in Anantnag district and that he had escaped from an encounter on June 30 in Anantnag in which two of his comrades were killed. It, however, did not say what happened to the others if “terrorists” were learnt to be present in the Srinagar locality on Thursday night as was mentioned in its statement.",
    "Meanwhile, life looked like being ‘normal’ in our neighbourhood Friday morning. Thousands of people have perished and widespread destruction has taken place in J&K in the past three decades and still every morning starts with a new hope."

    ": Suspension of the H1-B visas by the US will cost domestic IT firms Rs 1,200 crore and have a marginal 0.25-0.30 per cent impact on their profitability, a domestic rating agency said on Monday.",
    "An increase in local hiring over the last few years since the US  the largest market for Indian IT firms - started curbing the visa issuances will help limit the impact on the Indian IT companies now, Crisil Ratings said.",
    " ",
    "It can be noted that last month, the visas used by Indian tech professionals to work out of the US were suspended by the Donald Trump administration as it looked to arrest the rising unemployment.",
    "Crisil, however, said that the marginal impact will be over and above the up to 2.50 per cent decline in IT firms' profits because of the COVID-19 pandemic and added that operating profitability is seen at 23 per cent in FY21 as per an analysis of 15 top firms' performance.",
    "The US move on the H1-B and L1 visas will have limited impact because of the lower reliance on the entry system by hiring locally, it said, adding that renewals of the visas will be unaffected.",
    "Zooming of the denial rates to 39 per cent in FY20, up from 6 per cent in FY16, had led to lower reliance on the visas by the local IT companies, it said.",
    "\"New H1-B visa issuances contribute less than 5 per cent of the US onshore workforce of the top 5 listed Indian IT firms, which account for 60 per cent of the industry revenue. On the other hand, the share of local hires in their US onshore employee mix has steadily increased from 30-35 per cent in fiscal 2017 to about 55-60 per cent in fiscal 2020, its senior director Anuj Sethi said.",
    "With IT firms aiming to increase the share of local talent, especially with digital skills, the transition impact is expected to be marginal for them, he added.",
    "The US has proposed a transition of the existing H1-B visa issuance to a merit-based programme (criteria for capping new visas at 85,000 to be decided on quantum of salary rather than the lottery system currently) or a potential increase in minimum salary floor, it noted.",
    "Assuming employee requirements through new visa approvals (6,137 units in fiscal 2019) are completely met via local hiring and considering a 25 per cent premium for local hiring over the H1-B route, the additional cost burden on IT firms may not exceed Rs 1,200 crore, it said.",
    "\"Additionally, with higher share of employees working from home and with continued restrictions on mobility due to the pandemic, the onshore requirements of IT firms are likely to be lower,\" its director Sameer Charania said.",
    "The ratings agency said it does not expect any material impact on the credit quality of most IT firms as their financial risk profile is healthy."

    "Then came COVID-19 and George Floyd — one killing Black people in alarming numbers, the other shining a harsh light on systemic racism. In a matter of months and nearly 8 minutes, it became clear that institutions designed to ensure the two most important things in life — health and safety — had converged to turn against one segment of the population in stark, horrific ways.",
    "It’s a brutal blow to Black people’s well-being and renewed calls for racial justice in all realms including health care. Doctors and their patients are reeling from the impact.",
    "“We are exhausted and we are not OK,” said Dr Patrice Harris, a psychiatrist who just ended her yearlong term as president of the American Medical Association. She was speaking not so much for herself as for her community.",
    "Police violence is always an injustice, “but its harm is elevated amid the remarkable stress people are facing amid the COVID-19 pandemic,” Harris and AMA Trustee Dr Jesse Ehrenfeld said in a recent online opinion article.",
    "Floyd’s death is the most extreme example of over-policing that has long plagued Black and brown communities. It has been linked with elevated stress, high blood pressure and other chronic illness that contribute to the high virus death rates in Black people.",
    "As their offices start reopening for regular appointments, doctors are bracing for the fallout: a wave of sicker, shell-shocked patients.",
    "As a physician, Harris knows she has a certain privilege. But she also knows firsthand the weariness of Black lives in America.",
    "Harris was only the second Black physician to lead the AMA in its 173-year history. She gets “those looks” when walking into stores. She’s been asked to fetch coffee while wearing scrubs and a stethoscope.",
    "“It’s not that we don’t have any more to give,” Harris said. But there’s a feeling among many that if Floyd’s death can’t spark meaningful change for Black Americans, nothing will.",
    "Dr Brittani James is a primary-care doctor. Most of her patients on Chicago’s South Side are Black.",
    "Her neighbourhood was one of the last in the city to get a COVID-19 testing site. They opened first in wealthier, whiter North Side areas.",
    "“When I talk about institutional racism, this is happening in real time,” James said.",
    "She has seen the virus hit many of her patients, while others grow sicker from chronic disease, and it’s heartbreaking, James said. “As a Black doctor, I feel like I’m failing my patients every day,” she said.",
    "While her clinic has remained open, many patients are too terrified of COVID-19 to come in. That means trying to treat complaints without physical exams or blood tests. She has tried sending patients prescriptions for blood pressure cuffs but some can’t afford the cost. The options are “have their blood pressure uncontrolled or adjust their medications blind,” she said.",
    "For every patient who has called for an appointment, there are 10 others she hasn’t heard from in months.",
    "“There is no way that all of a sudden overnight there’s no more heart attacks, no more strokes, no more patients having poorly controlled diabetes,” she said. “We have all seen our patients’ visits stop. Which is scaring me a lot. ‘’",
    "It’s not just happening in Chicago.",
    "James fears a “second wave” of worsening chronic illness and non-COVID-19 deaths is coming.",
    "There are signs it is already happening.",
    "Government statistics from late January through May 30 suggest an increase in U.S. deaths from chronic diseases compared with historical trends. They include 7,000 excess deaths from hypertension, about 4,000 from diabetes and 3,000 from strokes — all conditions that disproportionately affect Black people, although the data don’t include race.",
    "James says Floyd’s brutal death has added psychological trauma to the mix, and mental health care in many communities is scarce.",
    "“There is an overwhelming need that we do not have the resources to address,” she said. “It’s devastating.”",
    "Royanna Williams, 45, is a Black woman in Asheville, North Carolina, who suffers with persistent pain from autoimmune illnesses, which disproportionately affect Blacks.",
    "Living with chronic illness had already left her anxious and depressed — feelings that have multiplied with the pandemic, Floyd’s death and the unrest that has followed.",
    "“This right here is a whole ’nother ballgame,” she said.",
    "Williams has started mental health televisits. They’ve helped.",
    "Her medicines include hydroxychloroquine. Williams said she figured she’d have trouble getting refills the minute Donald Trump began promoting it without evidence that it works for COVID-19. “I was livid,” she said.",
    "She hasn’t had to miss a dose yet, but Trump’s involvement has sparked mistrust. “Now I’m scared to take it,” she said. “I don’t know what’s in those pills.’’",
    "She says white doctors have often discounted her pain and it has worsened as the pandemic has postponed her physical therapy sessions. Research has shown that Blacks are often under-treated for pain, partly because of false beliefs about supposed biological differences. As recently as 2016, data showed that half of U.S. medical students and residents believed Blacks didn’t feel pain the same way as other races.",
    "Now there’s evidence that Blacks with fever and cough are less likely than whites to be referred for COVID-19 testing, said Dr Malika Fair, a health equity director at the Association of American Medical Colleges.",
    "“Race is a social construct and not based on biology or genetics,” Fair said.",
    "Dr. Heidi Knoll, who is white and one of Williams’ physicians, says a history of mistrust and mistreatment is part of what keeps many Black people from seeking medical care in ordinary times. COVID-19’s toll and government’s missed opportunities in handling the pandemic have compounded the problem, she said.",
    "Her clinic, Mountain Area Health Education Center in Asheville, rushed to adopt telehealth for non-COVID treatment when the pandemic hit; now nearly half of all patient visits are by phone or video. Telehealth has expanded throughout the United States during the pandemic and Knoll, like many physicians, thinks it may help reduce racial health disparities by increasing access to doctors.",
    "Williams knows her health makes her especially vulnerable to the virus. She has been terrified to go out since March, but staying home, where she lives with her autistic son and mother, has been stressful.",
    "The recent protests over Floyd’s killing have given her hope that racial change may be coming — especially because whites have been involved in the demonstrations.",
    "“People are amped up because of this pandemic,” she said. “Maybe he had to be that white lamb” — sacrificed so whites would pay attention.",
    "Terrence Nichols has recovered physically from a relatively mild case of COVID-19, diagnosed in March. But as a Black man in Chicago, knowing its impact in his community has left Nichols feeling fearful, vulnerable and angry over the president’s push to reopen.",
    "Blacks make up about 30% of Chicago’s population but almost half of the virus deaths, a disparity seen nationwide.",
    "As of early June, an AP analysis found that roughly 26% of COVID deaths were in Black patients, while Black people represented 13% of the population in the 40 states that provided detailed demographic data.",
    "When Brookings Institution researchers adjusted for age disparities between races on a national level — the white population in the U.S. is older, and thus more susceptible to COVID-19 than other races — they found that the death rate for Black individuals was 3.6 times than the rate of whites.",
    "“He’s ready to reopen because of the economy and rich people are losing money,” Nichols said of Trump. If the virus was disproportionately killing rich white people, ’’he would think twice,” said Nichols, 44.",
    "Chicago recently relaxed stay-home orders and eased other restrictions, allowing Nichols to resume his pharmacy sales rep job, but he’s in no hurry to go anywhere but to work.",
    "Nichols won’t join the protests in person, but he’s “inside the house raising my fist and cheering them on.”",
    "Floyd’s killing “struck a chord,” he said. “It’s been happening since before I was born.’’’",
    "His father is a physician; when Nichols was a teen the family lived in Chicago’s mostly white Beverly neighbourhood. He recalls being chased there by KKK members wielding bats, and questioned by officers about where he was going when he was just walking home.",
    "More recently, Nichols said, police “had me up against the car” and called for backup when he drove the wrong way on a one-way street.",
    "He routinely checks the rear-view mirror whenever he drives past a police car, “to see if they make a U-turn and start following me.” It has happened many times.",
    "“If you’re Black, it’s acceptable to be harassed,” Nichols said.",
    "Rosetta Watson is only 38 but she has heart failure and needs valve replacement surgery. When COVID-19 hit Chicago in March, doctors postponed the operation indefinitely. Obesity surgery to take the burden off her heart has also been delayed by the pandemic.",
    "She has sequestered herself at home, knowing COVID-19 could be fatal because of her poor health. It has already killed four of her relatives.",
    "“I don’t know if I’m angry or am just numb to it,” Watson said.",
    "She recently had her first appointment with her heart doctor since the pandemic hit, and was told her increasing fatigue may be from the leaky valve. She understands that COVID-19 cases are more urgent but the delays are frustrating.",
    "Meantime, she has watched the news, seen the protests on TV, heard about them trashing the local pharmacy. She supports the cause but not the property damage.",
    "The Floyd death “is the same as it has always been. We’ve always had prejudice.” The difference is now “everyone is recording everything they see.”",
    "She’s been racially targeted, not by police but by strangers who disparage her white boyfriend with racist terms and by elderly neighbours in her apartment building who deride “you people” and won’t ride with her in the elevator.",
    "She’s been racially profiled by a doctor who when Watson asked about her nose bleeds, demanded to know whether she had been “doing any recreational drugs like cocaine or heroin.” Turns out nose bleeds are a side effect of the nasal spray the doctor had prescribed.",
    "“Seriously, it’s 2020. When we gonna grow up?” Watson said."

    ": North Korea on Tuesday repeated it has no immediate intent to resume dialogue with the United States hours before U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun was to arrive in South Korea for discussions on the stalled nuclear diplomacy.",
    "In a statement released through Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency, senior North Korean foreign ministry official Kwon Jong Gun also ridiculed South Korea’s “nonsensical” calls for revived negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang when it has lost its relevance as a mediator.",

    "The State Department said Biegun, who is also President Donald Trump’s special representative for North Korea, during his meetings with officials in South Korea and Japan this week will discuss allied cooperation on a range of issues, including the “final, fully verified denuclearization” of North Korea.",
    "Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have met three times since embarking on their high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018. But negotiations have faltered since their second summit in February last year in Vietnam, where the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capability.",
    "Amid the stalemate in talks, North Korea has repeatedly said in recent months that it would no longer gift Trump with high-profile meetings he could boast of as his foreign policy achievements unless it gets something substantial in return.",
    "The North has also been dialing up pressure on the South, cutting off virtually all cooperation and blowing up an inter-Korean liaison office in its territory last month, following months of frustration over Seoul’s unwillingness to defy U.S.-led sanctions and restart joint economic projects that would help its broken economy.",
    "“Explicitly speaking once again, we have no intention to sit face to face with U.S.,” Kwon said in the statement.",
    "Some analysts believe North Korea will avoid serious talks with the Americans for now and instead focus on pressuring the South in a bid to increase its bargaining power before an eventual return to negotiations after the U.S. presidential election in November. They say the North likely doesn’t want to make any major commitments or concessions when there is a chance U.S. leadership could change.",
    "Kwon’s statement came days after North Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Sun Hui, whom Biegun had described as his potential counterpart when talks resume, insisted the North won’t resume negotiations unless Washington discards what it describes as “hostile” policies toward Pyongyang. She criticized the Trump administration for considering the diplomacy with the North as “nothing more than a tool for grappling its political crisis.”",
    "Without naming him outright, Kwon also took a jab at South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who in a video conference with European leaders last week expressed hope that Trump and Kim would meet again before the U.S. presidential elections.",
    "“(Choe’s) statement also mentioned the meddlesome man who had again indicated his intention to arbitrate between the DPRK and the U.S.,” Kwon said, referring to North Korea by its formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.",
    "“We feel sorry to see (the South) trying so hard to become the ‘mediator’ but it may try as much as it wants if it cherishes so strong wish to try it to the end. Time will show whether its efforts will succeed or it will only suffer a loss and ridicule.”",
    "Biegun will meet with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha on Wednesday before leaving for Japan on Thursday, Kang’s ministry said."

    "Among the many drugs that the Drug Controller General of India has been approving for the treatment of Covid-19, two anti-viral drugs Favipiravir for those with mild to moderate symptoms of coronavirus in Covid-19 patients and Remdesivir for Covid-19 patients on oxygen support have been at the forefront.",
    "Favipiravir was launched recently by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Cipla and Hetero introduced Remdesivir. Many experts, however, have raised concerns on its efficacy. For instance, both these drugs were originally designed to treat other diseases such as any skin disease or arthritis.",
    " ",
    "Similarly, Remdesivir is an experimental anti-viral drug, which is being studied for Ebola. Now, though, the companies have introduced the drugs’ generic version to treat coronavirus patients, especially Remdesivir being used on compassionate grounds to counter Covid-19.",
    "Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. (DRL), a global pharmaceutical company headquartered in India, is scaling up antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which is now being used as a prophylactic drug for Covid-19.",
    "The company had already launched hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in the US in 2018. Moreover, FUJIFILM Corporation has partnered with DRL and Global Response Aid for the development, manufacture and sales of Avigan Tablets for Covid-19.",
    "Dr Viswesvaran Balasubramanian, Senior Interventional Pulmonologist & Sleep Medicine Specialist, Yashoda Hospitals",
    "Manufacturers claim that the drug administration in 88% of patients (across age groups 20 to 90 years) with mild to moderate cases resulted in a clinical improvement and that the drug can be used in mild to moderate Covid-19 patients with comorbidities such as diabetes and heart disease.",
    "However, the positive results from the study should be interpreted with caution as other therapies were administered in this non-randomised, open-label study, which could have confused the results. “Though a multinational, randomised placebo-controlled trial observed reduced time to recovery from severe Covid-19 with use of Remdesivir, another study conducted in China reported conflicting results. The drug shouldn’t be used in patients having hypersensitivity to any ingredients of the formulation, patients with gross liver enzyme and renal function abnormalities.",
    "K.I. Varaprasad Reddy, (founder of vaccine manufacturing company Shantha Biotechnics)",
    "The new norm now is to have drugs repurposed. These drugs were not designed for coronavirus. And they were already in existence for different purposes. ‘Repurposed drugs’ are those that are not actually meant for a certain disease but might be used to fight it in the absence of anything else.",
    "With this drug-repurposing, we get accustomed to thinking that such drugs are all antiviral, which may not be the case. Favipiravir, for instance, was made in Japan about 13 years ago for influenza. Doctors using Favipiravir in the trials for Covid-19 observed that the drug suppressed the symptoms in people suffering from mild attacks of corona. However, the drug does not offer total safety and the disease may recur in the patient. There can be grave side effects too  some people die with these drugs! ”",
    "Dr Nageshwar Reddy, MD of Asian Institute of Gastroenterology",
    "There have been no randomised studies in which both the drugs have shown to decrease the number of days of illness. Let us not forget that its use has been recommended only in the case of a mild to moderate attack of the disease in patients, most of whom recover normally. So, to do a randomised control trial (RCT), it would take not only large numbers of patients but also a long time. The Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) has granted permissions for using these drugs only in view of the pandemic. Otherwise, the rules are very stringent, and it takes very long to get the permissions. However, these are a part of the armamentarium against Covid-19, but we still don’t have a magic bullet like, say, antibiotics against bacterial infections.”",
    "G.V. Prasad, co-chairman and managing director of DRL",
    "These drugs have not undergone full controlled trials yet. There are three stages in a Covid-19 attack  Asymptomatic is when one needs to merely fortify the patient with vitamins and zinc supplement. The second stage is when a patient exhibits mild symptoms.",
    "In most cases around the world, people are trying various approaches to combat the mild symptoms, and Favipiravir has been approved in China and Russia for this indication. Remdesivir has been showing some benefit for Covid-19 patients on oxygen and ventilator.",
    "All these drugs, however, exist for other problems and indications, and are being ‘repurposed’ for Covid-19. Many countries have been conducting human trials as we speak.",
    "How close are we to manufacturing the vaccine?",
    "Quite like the opinions by experts all around the world, Varaprasad Reddy shares that we will not come out with a vaccine at least until next year May or June. “To escalate the production itself takes three to four months. Some companies in India have already started boasting that they have come up with a vaccine. We do not have the money to develop anything here. Recently, there was news that a vaccine is out and that it is in Phase-One trial, and that it will then have Phases Two and Three after which the company hopes to get a license and start production. Then, they would need to escalate the production of the vaccine. And when a few millions samples of the vaccine are available, only then can people start getting it,” he explains.",
    "To illustrate the logistics and money involved in the production and testing of vaccines, Varaprasad shares the example of the Gates Foundation. “Gavi and Gates Foundation realised that they require at least 1. 5 billion doses of vaccine a day at six centres across the globe, which would entail untold logistics to be able to manufacture and supply it to all these six centres throughout the globe. It would take billions in,” states Varaprasad.",
    "“No one has developed any vaccine here. People are only doing clinical trials yet. This is what was done for Remdesivir, too in small trials for 100 or 200 people. When everything seemed okay, these companies were given license to sell Remdesivir for Covid-19,” elaborates Varaprasad Reddy."

    "According to the 1994 “Sex in America” survey conducted by University of Chicago researchers, 54 percent of men think about sex every day or several times a day, but two thirds of women say they think about sex only a few times a month or, at most, a few times a week.",
    "And when asked about sexual difficulties, about 15% of men reported lacking interest in sex at some point in the last 12 months, where as one in three women could not be bothered.",
    "The discrepancy between sex drives mars millions of marriages. It eats away at long-term relationships, robs us of feelings of attractiveness, and leads us to assume that the passion is fizzling out. It makes wives wonder too, “Why am I not craving this man’s love? What’s wrong?”",
    "Here are some ways to deal with discrepancies:",
    "Sex drive is an appetite, much like hunger or thirst. It tends to establish its own level and stay there, defining one’s sexuality for much of our adult life.",
    "It is thrown off track only by major changes like alcoholism, depression, and the side effects of medication or the onset of certain illness like diabetes or Parkinson’s disease, Andropause etc.",
    "Somehow, many of us cruise right into old age with the fires still burning.",
    "Research has shown the hormone testosterone to greatly affect sex drive in both men and women.",
    "Some believe the reason why men experience more desire than women is that men have 10 to 20 times more testosterone than women.",
    "For persons with low testosterone, factors like stress, lack of time and daily distractions will come in the way of a good sex drive.",
    "In those with adequate testosterone levels, these distractions will not matter much. In fact, sex will relieve their stress.",
    "And what when you have a high sex drive:",
    "\r\n*  Be romantic while asking for sex.",
    "\r\n*  Initiate sex out of love and desire, not habit.",
    "\r\n*  Learn to seduce.",
    "\r\n&  Respect your partner’s moods and preferences."

    "Your skin is the most sensitive organ in the body that undergoes a lot of wear and tear with time. While rashes and pimples are a common occurrence, more visible ones like a type skin pigmentation also called acanthosis nigricans, are easily visible and can make one feel conscious of themselves.",
    "Dermatologist and aesthetic physician Dr Ajay Rana explains that these thick dark skin patches are a symptom of an underlying disorder that takes place when skin cells start reproducing quickly.",
    " ",
    "“The cause for acanthosis nigricans is still not clearly known, but it appears to be related to insulin resistance. It has been associated with various benign and malignant conditions,” he says.",
    "Based on the pre-disposing conditions, acanthosis nigricans has been broadly divided into seven types, out of which obesity-induced acanthosis nigricans is the most common. It can occur at any age, but is more common in adulthood. Hereditary is one of the important factors for acanthosis nigricans.",
    "According to cosmetic dermatologist and laser specialist Dr Abhijit Desai, the most common reason for extra darkening of elbows or knees is just the accumulation of dead skin over a period of time and skin thickening due to friction while sitting in different postures.",
    "Dr Sunita Dube, Founder and Chairperson of Aryan Hospital, Mumbai, further explains that people with naturally darker skin tones are more likely to develop dark elbows and knees.",
    "“Dark spots on the skin, or hyperpigmentation, occur when more melanin  it adds colour to the lips, skin, and hair is formed in some areas of the skin,” she says, adding, “Some common causes include certain drugs like birth control pills, a scar from a healed bite of insects, psoriasis, an allergic reaction, hormonal changes from pregnancy, a build-up of dead skin, exposure to the sun, age spots, bumps, etc. In fact, diabetes can also cause areas of skin to become darker.”",
    "Dr Desai advises moisturising the affected area twice a day to keep it soft and control the dryness. Specifically, he suggests using a moisturiser containing urea as it helps get rid of existing dull and dead skin while simultaneously moisturising it.",
    "Whereas, Dr Rana suggests maintaining a healthy diet as it is the most important factor in the growth of acanthosis nigricans and can often times clear up after weight loss.",
    "“Intake of fruits, vegetables, whole-grain bread, low-fat dairy products, beans, lean meats, and fish, as a healthy diet can control blood sugar levels of the body. Follow a regular exercise regime for 30 minutes. Exercise can help control your blood sugar level and also help to manage the weight of the body,” lists the dermatologist.",
    "Dr Dube, on the other hand, recommends using sunblock as it protects the skin from the UV rays of the sun. “An individual may also take steps such as keeping the elbows clean and moist, using exfoliating soaps to remove the dead skin around the elbows, and regularly reapplying the sunblock while in the sun,” she says.",
    "Since under lockdown, Dr Dube lists home remedies that may help with lightening the dark patch around the elbows. “Grind oatmeal mix with water, apply on the patch, and leave it till the skin absorbs. Or, rub a lemon on the patch as citrus fruit are known to provide some protection from sun exposure and help lighten the skin. Thirdly, aloe vera has soothing properties that also help in lightening the pigmentation of the skin. Lastly, turmeric paste has medicinal properties and helps in lightening the dark spots,” she says."

  ],
  "content": [
    "Much like any other professional domain, men have also dominated the field of wildlife conservation for a long time but India’s Tiger Princess is gradually changing the game.",
    "Latika Nath – India’s first woman to become a wildlife biologist with a doctorate on tigers – has dedicated her life to studying and protecting the big cat.",
    " ",
    "Working closely with the tigers for 25 years, Nath has dived deep in the adventurous and challenging profession that has often put her in death-defying conditions. But even in hindsight, Nath would not have it otherwise.",
    "“It’s been a fantastic journey so far. I don’t think there is anything that I would have done differently or changed anything. If I would have done something else, I would have come back to this,” says the conservationist, who chose this field of work at the age of six. “I decided it then, stuck to it, and I am continuously doing it. I am walking on the path that I chose years back,” she smiles.",
    "Braving the storm",
    "At an age when a child can hardly hold a book, Nath was learning about forest animals from her father who served as a member of the Indian Board of Wildlife.",
    "“All the people I knew in my childhood were either doctors or wildlife conservationists, so everything around me was about animals and forest, which would interest me a lot,” shares the biologist who spent most of her childhood visiting the wilderness with her father.",
    "Nath followed her passion and graduated with a degree in environmental science, which was rare or entirely unheard of at the time. Although, earlier in her career, the scientist had to deal with the downside of being a woman in a male-dominated field, and also overcome wrongful accusations of data-fabrication.",
    "“People wanted to stop my research and made false accusations against me, but that’s a part of anything exceptional you want to do. Nothing kept me away from what I wanted to do,” she asserts.",
    "She further recalls that many people underestimated her because of her privileged background. “People in the know of my background were certain that I won’t be able to live in harsh conditions because I come from a comfortable background, but all those notions became vindictive,” she smiles, adding that she chose to not focus on the noise.",
    "Picture perfect",
    "In addition to her superseding identity of India’s Tiger Princess, Nath leads multiple lives — as a scientist, conservationist, wildlife photographer, author, and researcher. Following her illustrious work on tiger conservation, Nath soon developed a knack for wildlife photography, and has also been working closely with tribal communities in India to resolve human-wildlife conflicts.",
    "Her pictures of the wildcats are a reflection of her knowledge about wildlife. “It’s not my profession, but because I spend many hours in the field, I do photography as well. As a wildlife biologist, I can understand rare animal behaviours, and so my work is different from others,” she shrugs, adding that she wants to remind people to care about wildlife through her photographs.",
    "At a time when wildlife photography has become a passion for every other photographer, Nath reveals that it’s not easy. “It’s about ethics and limits. It is much beyond capturing the subject; it is about emotions. One needs to learn to empathise with whatever animal you are dealing with,” explains Nath who has travelled across the globe to photograph animals such as tigers, leopards, lions, snow leopards, and dolphins, among many others.",
    "Learning from the West",
    "When asked if the West inspires her work, Nath is quick to respond with a nod but rues that people in India are not ready to share and help. “Everyone is so territorial about what they are doing. The biggest difference between the West and India is the fact that people are not willing to share and that stops people from doing some extraordinary work here,” she avers.",
    "It’s no secret that India’s national animal is also one of the most endangered species on the earth. As a conservationist, Nath has had a bird’s-eye view on what’s threatening the survival of the wildcats and attributes the damage to individuals’ lack of awareness.",
    "“We need to inculcate the value of caring for the environment in our daily life, in everything we do. Protecting wildlife should be an integral component of any development planning,” she suggests before signing off."

    "Are you susceptible to food allergies? Dr Anish Anand, Consultant Internal Medicine, shares insights"
  ],
  "date_published": [
    "Published  "
  ],
  "content": [
    "In May 2019, singer Ariana Grande had quite the food-scare, when a severe allergic reaction to tomatoes forced her to cancel two Florida concerts. “We discovered … that … I had an unfortunate allergic reaction to tomatoes and my throat pretty much closed,” the singer explained via an Instagram post.",
    "What is food allergy? We enquire on the subject with Dr J Anish Anand, Consultant Internal Medicine, Apollo Hospitals.",
    " ",
    "“Food allergy is the result of the immune system overreacting to a food or a substance in food, triggering a protective response from the body,” explains Dr Anish. “It is an immunological reaction suffered by some individuals resulting from the consumption of certain foods and it involves most of the times Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody, responsible for a wide range of anaphylactic reactions. Foods that induce excessive IgEsynthesis are called allergens.”",
    "\r\nThe doctor also informs that it was about 2,000 years ago, when Hyppocrates had recorded the first report of adverse reaction to foods such as milk. In India, the traditional systems of medicine describe many foods as causing ‘pitta vata’.",
    "Allergy risks",
    "Everybody reacts differently to various types of foods and ingredients. However, some of the aspects playing a role in causing allergies include the following:",
    "\r\n1.,Family history, asthma, eczema, hives or allergies such as hay fever",
    "\r\n2. Asthma and food allergy commonly occur together",
    "\r\n3.  Previous allergies to one type of food, which might increase the risk of one becoming allergic to another",
    "\r\n4. Age: Food allergies are more common in children, especially toddlers and infants, although children also typically outgrow allergies to milk, soy, wheat and eggs.",
    "Types of food allergies",
    "l IgE-mediated food allergy: This is triggered by the immune system producing an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). Symptoms could occur a few seconds or even minutes after eating. It comes with a  risk of anaphylaxis — a severe and life-threatening reaction.",
    "1. Non-IgE-mediated food allergy: These allergies are not caused by immunoglobulin E but by other cells in the immune system. This type of allergy is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms take much longer to develop.",
    "2. Mixed IgE and non-IgE-mediated food allergies: Some people may experience symptoms from both types.",
    "Symptoms",
    "Symptoms of food allergies range from mild discomfort to severe, life-threatening reactions, which require immediate medical intervention. Dr Anish even points out that the allergic reactions to food generally occur within a few minutes to one hour after eating the offending food, with symptoms lasting for days or even weeks. He also cautions that food allergy remains the principle safety concern especially for foods derived from recombinant-DNA.",
    "“Genetically modified foods contain newly expressed proteins that may present a risk for the food-allergic individual. And even small amounts of the offending food can cause serious — and in some cases, even fatal reactions — in susceptible individuals,” adds Dr Anish.",
    "“Fortunately, the outcome is not death in most cases but various symptoms affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, eyes, and/or central nervous system.”",
    "Allergies could manifest in any of the following organs or forms:",
    "\r\n1. Skin (itching, redness & swelling)",
    "\r\n2. Gastrointestinal tract (e.g., nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea)",
    "\r\n3. Respiratory tract ( asthma, itching and swelling of nose and throat)",
    "\r\n4. Eyes (e.g., itching and swelling)",
    "\r\n5. Cardiovascular system (e.g., chest pain, abnormal heart rhythm and very low blood pressure)",
    "Treating allergies",
    "“It is very difficult to observe strict elimination especially in India where prepared food is a complex mixture,” the doctor adds. “Because of a lack of clinical data, doctors  recommend dietary restrictions.”",
    "Medication",
    "Several drugs have been used to protect patients with food allergy, such as HI 1–12 antihistamines, steroids and sodium chromoglyate.",
    "“However, one needs to understand that these medications only have short-term effect or no measurable effect,” says the doctor. “The efficacy of immunotherapy in food allergy is still controversial and could occasionally produce severe systemic reactions.”",
    "Prevention",
    "The best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to know and avoid foods that cause signs and symptoms. “Some foods — when used as ingredients in certain dishes — may be well-hidden. This is especially true in restaurants and in other social settings,” cautions Dr Anish."

    " ",
    "Elder brother and India all-rounder Krunal took up the challenge, posting a video of him doing the exercise with ease.",
    "Then, Virat Kohli joined in, posting a video on his social media page of him doing the same exercises, with a little twist. Then, he captioned the post with a call out to the Pandya brothers. “Hey H @hardikpandya7 loved your fly push ups ????. Here’s adding a little clap to it ??,” said his caption.",
    "Hardik then responded to Kohli’s challenge, taking it up one notch higher, doing the push ups with a clap at the back!",
    "Not to be left out, Test cricket opener Mayank Agarwal joined in. He posted on his social media a photograph of him hanging upside down while doing balance training. “On a scale of 1 to 10, the head rush I get when I’m trying to explore the “Upside Down” is ELEVEN,” Mayank captioned his post. Kohli’s comment on that was, “Kya ho gaya bhai. Lockdown has reached unbearable limits I guess (sic).”",
    "Caution: Copy cats can get injured",
    "Even as the fun and games between the players kept getting more challenging and trickier, Bengaluru-based fitness expert and India’s premier expert for elite sports performance and injury prevention, Deckline Leitao, decided to step in to caution youngsters from copying the exercises and fitness programs being executed by Team Indian captain Virat Kohli and his team.",
    "Speaking to Deccan Chronicle via telephone, Deckline said, “The exercises shown are a form of explosive lifts and plyometric push-ups. They are effective for shoulder power and total body control and coordination. These are technically advanced exercises, and newcomers should ensure that they have built adequate muscle endurance, stability and strength before attempting to master these.”",
    "Deckline added that if not executed with the right posture and strength, the landing impact and the explosive nature of the exercises could potentially overload areas such as the wrists and shoulders in inexperienced players.",
    "In the meanwhile, Kohli also posted the video of him lifting 40 kg weight. “If I had to make a choice of one exercise to do everyday, this would be it. Love the power snatch (sic),” he captioned the video post, adding to it emojis of flexed biceps and a grinning, happy face.",
    "Again, Deckline, who has been training players for over two decades, shared observations he thought young players and fitness buffs need to understand before copying these exercises. “Both Virat Kohli and Hardik are experienced players with a keen interest in fitness,” he explained.",
    "“They are also experienced in performing advanced-conditioning exercises, which is why they are able to perform such advanced movements. However, younger players shouldn’t try to simply copy their fitness routines and should train according to their own physical capacity, training experience and injury history.”"

  "content": [
    "When Esha Singh narrowly missed making it to the Tokyo Olympics in the pistol shooting category early this February, she was naturally disappointed. She had finished third. But as luck would have it, another window of opportunity has opened for her.",
    "With the Olympics being pushed to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic, she is on the list of shooters named by the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) last Friday as part of the probables for the Olympics. This gives Esha a year to improve her points to make it to the Games.",
    " ",
    "“I stand a great chance of making it to the Olympics if I can improve my rankings in this year’s championships,” says the Hyderabad shooter. “This time, I am excited and confident that I can better my rankings and points with my performance.",
    "For now, Esha will train at home. “I have the entire infrastructure, so I shall practise in my house until the association asks us to join the training camp in November,” says the Asian Champion, adding that her immediate challenge is to knock off the rustiness.",
    "“Although I have been practising, I haven’t played any matches of late due to the lockdown. So, I need to warm up and get into the groove quickly. My personal trainer and physiotherapist has been helping me on that,” the Junior World Cup medallist says.",
    "At 15, Esha is the youngest Indian in the pistol shooting category to be part of the Olympic core training group. “I feel so excited and proud! Since I am still young, I believe I have the great advantage of being able to continue in the sport for a long time,” says Esha, who won the Junior Women’s Air pistol Silver and the Mixed Air Pistol Bronze (with Gaurav Rana), in the Junior World Cup in 2019.",
    "\r\nEsha, who took to the sport at the age of nine, has come a long way. “Playing at the highest level and on the world stage made me realise that I should be grateful for the opportunities I have had. The more you push yourself, the more you understand yourself,” she explains.",
    "A Standard X student, Esha admits that managing studies and sport was challenging. “But my teachers have been supportive. I am like a special student for them (smiles). Whenever I had to be away to play a tournament, they would walk the extra mile to tutor me on my return,” reveals Esha.",
    "“When I became the National Champion in 2018, my entire class came to the airport to give me a warm welcome. It was a thrilling moment,” says Esha who trains for 3-4 hours a day during the lockdown. “The pandemic taught me to enjoy the sport rather than take it seriously. Every time I prepare for a championship, I carry pressure; but the pandemic made me realise that fundamentally, our mindset should be very open,” she says.",
    "The spirited youngster feels that failures helped her become what she is today. “I have had bad phases, but every tournament taught me a lesson. As the saying goes, ‘everything happens for a reason’, if I hadn’t encountered those failures, perhaps I would not know how to handle pressure in crucial ties in the future,” she signs off."

    ": NASCAR has launched an investigation after a noose was found in the garage stall of Bubba Wallace, the only Black driver in the elite Cup Series who just two weeks ago successfully pushed the stock car series to ban the Confederate flag at its venues.",
    "NASCAR said the noose was found on Sunday afternoon and vowed to do everything possible to find who was responsible and “eliminate them from the sport.”",
    " ",
    "“We are angry and outraged, and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we take this heinous act,” the series said in a statement. “As we have stated unequivocally, there is no place for racism in NASCAR, and this act only strengthens our resolve to make the sport open and welcoming to all.”",
    "On Twitter, Wallace said the “the despicable act of racism and hatred leaves me incredibly saddened and serves as a painful reminder of how much further we have to go as a society and how persistent we must be in the fight against racism.”",

    "At Talladega, in the heart of the South, as many as 5,000 fans were allowed in, even though rain postponed the race until Monday and visitors were barred from the infield. No flags were spotted Sunday, but cars and pickup trucks driving along nearby roads were flying the flag and parading past the entrance to the superspeedway over the weekend. A small plane flew over the track Sunday pulling a banner with the flag and the words “Defund NASCAR.”",

    "Wallace, a 26-year-old Alabama native, said he has found support among fellow drivers for his stance on the flag. He noted that in his tweet after the noose announcement."

However, the actress has been unable to attend the choreographer’s prayer meet as she is busy at home taking care of her 87-year-old mother, who hasn’t been in the pink of her health. Sources say that owing to this, Madhuri has requested Saroj Khan’s daughter Sukaina to try and keep the prayer meet for later as she is very keen to attend. “",
    "Madhuri wants to be at the prayer meet as Saroj ji is also like a mother to her in the film industry, who has held her hand for years and is responsible for making her the graceful diva that she is. Hence, she requested Sukaina if the prayer meeting could be kept at a more suitable time. Other filmmakers, actors and actresses too want to be there for the meet. Yet another point is also that there are hundreds of dancers who are indebted to Saroj Khan for her help and guidance over the years. Hence Saroj ji’s family is thinking of keeping the prayer meet, perhaps after a month or two, when the Covid situation also improves, as the current situation does not allow many people to be present for the meet,” says a source.   ",

    " In view of the alarming rise in COVID-19 cases, the Karnataka government has put restrictions on movement of people and transport. Buses will not be permitted into Bengaluru on Sundays, and people can travel on AP State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) and Karnataka State Road Transport buses only if they are registered on the Suvidha App of the Karnataka government.",
    "APSRTC authorities at the Anantapur depot said passengers without clearance on the Karnataka government app will not be permitted in buses at initial points in Anantapur, Kurnool , Kadapa and other depots.",
    " ",
    "Sources said APSRTC operates around four bus services to Bengaluru every day but the occupancy has been very poor. A small number of passengers travel to Mantralayam in Kurnool district but the moola brindavanam of Sri Raghavendra Swamy and the math at Mantralayam see large numbers of devotees from all parts of the country, a majority from Karnataka. KSRTC operates buses from Bengaluru and Raichur.",
    "A math official from Mantralayam told Deccan Chronicle that the restrictions were in place to prevent spread of the coronavirus. “The math is not allowing devotees to come close to the moola brindavanam, and annadanam centres are closed. Devotees are being permitted in fewer numbers, according to the regulations,” he said.",
    "An RTC official from Anantapur depot observed that people were travelling to Bengaluru only for emergency reasons. Shravani, a passenger from Madakasira, said she had to go to Bengaluru to attend the annual ceremony of her mother and managed to get clearance through the app at the last minute. People in the border areas were hiring vehicles from nearby Karnataka border towns and bus stations.",
    "Tourist spots in Karnataka are also under lockdown. Online services and reservations are not available for major tourist spots. K Venugopal of Anantapur, who wanted to travel to Dandeli, a famous tourist spot in Karnataka, said, “We had spoken to the organisers over the phone and made all the necessary preparations to visit the spot and to stay for three days. But they informed us the stay had been cancelled,” he said. Organisers of tourist packages and major events, including the water games, have put these off till October."

    "Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.  The Chinese incursions in Ladakh have once again shown that the stereotype about regional parties that they do not have much interest or concern on issues of foreign policy and national security is by and large true.",
    "This is despite the fact that some regional parties project themselves as national like the All India Trinamul Congress, the AIADMK and the Nationalist Congress Party, to cite just a few.",
    " ",
    "BSP supremo Mayawati may like to project herself as a potential prime ministerial candidate but has hardly ever spoken about international issues.",
    "There might be some exceptions like the Dravidian parties such as the DMK, which have a firm view on the Sri Lankan Tamil question, Katchthivu island and problems faced by fishermen in the sea near Sri Lanka.",
    "Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav always believed that there is no bigger danger to India from China, a view publicly voiced by firebrand socialist George Fernandes when he was defence minister in the Atal Behari Vajpayee government some two decades back.",
    "In fact, the Chinese incursions have once again  brought to the fore the limitations of regional parties in upholding national issues, despite the fact that 20 Indian soldiers made the supreme sacrifice while defending the motherland.",
    "This is because, barring the Shiv Sena, hardly any party thought it fit to pose searching questions to the Narendra Modi government in this hour of national crisis, when a belligerent China under President Xi Jinping is in a tearing hurry to become the world’s biggest superpower.",
    "The Shiv Sena’s stand is no surprise given the fact that it has always sought to project that it is one up on the BJP on matters of national security, more so since Narendra Modi gained centrestage in May 2014. How much it has succeeded or not is a different matter.",
    "The only non-BJP chief minister who bluntly told the Prime Minister that India could not remain a passive spectator to what had happened in the Galwan Valley did not belong to any regional party but to the Congress. Punjab chief minister Capt. Amarinder Singh is also a former Armyman and a military historian.",
    "Amid charges and counter-charges between the BJP and the Congress, NCP supremo and former defence minister Sharad Pawar has pitched for “leaving it to the experts” the job of dealing with China, which is moving strategically.  He has also called for the convening of an early session of Parliament to send a message of national unity to Beijing.",
    "What has been witnessed in the past 20 days since the Galwan Valley clash is that the regional parties remained content only by underlining that they are backing the beleaguered government, apparently to be in the good books of the powers that be. That this suits the Narendra Modi government just fine is a different matter.",
    "But the tragedy is that these regional parties, during uncertain political times, have always attempted to punch above their weight nationally.",
    "They have played a role at the Centre in some way or the other since 1996 and had two Prime Ministers H.D. Deve Gowda and Inder Kumar Gujral heading governments supported from outside by the Congress.",
    "Ahead of the last Lok Sabha elections held over a year ago, the idea of a Federal Front was floated but had failed to get much traction when the issue of national security became uppermost in the minds of voters in the backdrop of the Pulwama terror attack and the subsequent Indian Air Force strikes in Balakot across the border.",
    "The idea of a Federal Front was not only to bring the regional parties together to form a government, but it was also projected as a reply to the centrist focus of national parties, where it was argued that the Union government become stronger at the cost of the state governments.",
    "The proponents of the idea had insisted that it was to strengthen the states so that they can progress. At the same time, it would also make the Union stronger.",
    "What has happened during the last 40 years is that the Union has strengthened itself so much at the cost of the states and is still doing so. That should come to an end. That was the alternative idea of the Federal Front, it was argued.",
    "But the idea was stillborn, apparently amid the conflicting claims, influence and ambitions of the regional leaders, who failed to project a national alternative. In fact, the idea simply failed to take off and remained a pipe dream.",
    "The irony is that time and again the regional parties have shown that they like to live in their cocoon, and generally do not like to move out of their comfort zones. Wittingly or unwittingly, they have left the national issues in the domain of the Centre, with the ruling party lording over it.",
    "Besides the Shiv Sena and to some extent the Samajwadi Party, hardly any party, besides the Congress, has taken a position on the incursions.",
    "The Aam Aadmi Party was not even invited to the all-party meeting. The Congress, rightly or wrongly, did raise some searching questions. The Left parties may be inconsequential, but they did raise hard questions.",
    "The job of the Opposition in a parliamentary democracy is to oppose, expose and depose. The trend seen since the saffron surge of May 2014 is that most of the regional parties want to be the loyal Opposition.",
    "The BJP’s politics under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah have made the regional parties wary, despite the fact that the BJP is gradually losing ground as seen in state polls in Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi and Jharkhand, even after achieving a spectacular comeback at the Centre in May last year.",
    "All in all, the regional parties will have to change their style and narrative in the coming years to avert growing marginalisation at the national level, where the Congress has remained a laggard for the last six years.",
    "Prime Minister Narendra Modi had once caustically shown his disdain for any Third Front experiment, insisting that it would turn India into a third-rate nation."

The contested strip of land would have done no more than given our children an extra yard in which to play, but we prized our peace of mind so much more.",
    "Most of all, left untended as it has now been for years (so awkwardly placed was it for our neighbour to use — almost as if it was meant to be in our garden!), this no-man’s land has erupted into a riot of long grasses, wildflowers, and visiting wildlife, that is a daily delight.",
    "In life, we are constantly erecting or bulldozing barricades that we pretend, in language, not to like — “I felt fenced in”, “It bordered on insanity”, “His anger knew no bounds”. But where’s the need for walls and silos when we are all just human? If you prick me, do I not bleed?",

Twenty years of being a British resident, whilst remaining an Indian citizen, because I haven’t got around to changing a situation I consider perfect.",

We have lived, worked and loved in different locales, retaining links with many, or at least happy memories. Britain is my home. I have lived here for most of my adult life. Here, where I met and married my husband, we have raised our beautiful children.",
    "India is also my home. That is where my parents dwell, and going back is always a homecoming. I grew up in the Philippines and so, that too is home. As are Bangladesh and Burma, lands of my ancestors, whose tales live on in me. France, where we often holiday, is a home away from home.",
    "And the Mediterranean, with its unexplained lure, is the home of my imagination. Everywhere is home, and most of us have mixed allegiances. So, why construct watertight compartments like nationalities? All it does is create factions and conflict. Why add to the ruin of the planet by wasting passport paper on concocted personalities?",
    "All it does is cause heartbreak when, as the tides of history wash over our castles in the sand, changing borders, and taking our hard-won identities with it, we are left as we began — just human.  ",
    "Yet the sensible keep prevailing upon me to make a choice, to pick a side in these heartless times of detainment and deportation, and they are undoubtedly right. And though I’d like to let it slide like every other year, oblivious to labels and legalities, loving people and places where I will, and just being me — because that’s the only ownership that should matter; over our own lives and deeds — I sense a decision in the offing. "

    "By the end of August, it will be one lakh cases a day. At that point, how many doctors will show up for work and how many will be able to is something to consider.",
    "There is no point in thinking about September and October, but consider that the places that are going through the peaks now are Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, which have the best healthcare facilities in India. When the disease spreads rapidly in places without urban healthcare, what will come is not difficult to imagine.",
    "Let us turn to the economy. India has few high frequency indicators that can tell us the current state of the economy and the change. The best such indicator we have is automobile sales, because at the beginning of each month manufacturers put out the number of units they have sold to dealers.",
    "We can compare the number to the same month last year to see how things are going.",
    "Passenger vehicle sales in January 2020 dropped to 2.6 lakh from 2.8 lakh in January 2019.",
    "That was before Covid-19, and two months before the lockdown. Commercial vehicle sales, meaning trucks and other transport and cargo vehicles that industry requires, fell from 87,000 units in January 2019 to 75,000 in January this year.",
    "Two-wheeler sales fell from 15 lakh to 13 lakh. Across the middle class, the lower middle class and industry, there is a decline.",
    "In February commercial vehicle sales fell by 32 per cent, and passenger vehicle sales by seven per cent.",
    "After zero sales in April, we should have had a huge bump in May and June, but both months are negative in substantial terms.",
    "There is something that is hurting the Indian economy, and this pain began before the lockdown. The government has not admitted it, though the data is clear, and therefore the government is not doing anything to correct it. The pain will continue, and our economy will suffer.",
    "As if these two problems were not substantial enough, we face the gravest strategic threat of the last two decades. China is bullying us and occupying parts of Ladakh that we used to patrol till March.",
    "We do not know why China is doing this and we do not know what it wants. This government has a former spy as its national security adviser, a position that is usually taken by scholars.",
    "We have a chief of defence staff whose focus has been on the counterinsurgency in Kashmir and was confident that the Line of Actual Control with China was settled. He was wrong. Now we are moving troops to the area from the Pakistan front and rushing to buy new warplanes.",
    "Strategic affairs analyst Praveen Sawhney has reported the reason that the talks with China are taking so long and not progressing. It is that the Chinese want India to acknowledge the current positions that its Army is occupying, meaning a shift in the LAC.",
    "Of course this can’t be conceded by us, but it cannot even be discussed properly because the prime minister has said there is no intrusion, while the defence minister and the external affairs minister have conceded that China has violated the LAC and are on our side. Narendra Modi's visit to Ladakh on Friday was to correct that confusion.",
    "His warlike speech was to confirm that the threat is real and the Chinese need to go back. He has still refused to name China, but perhaps that will come soon as it becomes obvious that we have a long and difficult road ahead to get the Chinese to vacate.",
    "One must say here that we have lost valuable time because of our refusal to accept the reality for whatever reason, whether it is embarrassment or the PM’s image. We could have mobilised support around the world if we had said openly and clearly that China was violating the LAC, but there’s no point in crying over spilt milk.",
    "We still have the opportunity when prime minister Modi goes to the G-7 summit in a few months, though it is not clear if China will have cemented its intrusion by then.",
    "So we have a full-blown epidemic, an economic recession with the highest unemployment in Indian history, and a powerful enemy whose aggressive and offensive actions we did not anticipate.",
    "At the beginning of the year I would have said that the biggest problem in our nation was the fact that the ruling party was trying to divide Indians.",
    "In the long term that remains our primary self-induced worry. But for now, we have to unite to combat the immediate threat to our people and our nation.",

    "Xi Jinping, while speaking at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in 2017 bemoaned the fact that Ancient China, once a great empire, was plumbed into the dimness of domestic turmoil by foreign aggression. Its prosperous people were reduced to penury, torn asunder, and compelled to subsist in destitution and despondency for over 100 years.",
    " ",
    "A bit of history may just be in order. China’s Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) actively engaged the outside world.  It dispatched huge maritime fleets on expeditions across Asia and right down to the coast of Africa.",
    "However, Ming China later retreated into seclusion for two centuries. Consequently, it missed the great intellectual renaissance and industrialisation that swept Europe and later the America’s.",
    "In 1839, China declared war on drugs by impounding over 1,000 tons of opium from British dealers in Canton (modern Guangzhou). The British drug cartels pressured London into demanding that Beijing recompense them the full street value of these narcotics.",
    "The Chinese emperor naturally snubbed this egregious extortion attempt. In 1840, British warships laid many Chinese coastal towns to waste. British troops slaughtered even non-combatants along the coastline. Thus, commenced the First Opium War.",
    "British traders were also flustered as a grave trade imbalance subsisted between the Qing China and Great Britain due to the latter’s astronomical demands for tea, porcelain, and silk. Tea import alone amounted to over 23 million pounds in 1800.",
    "The annual tab was 3.6 million pounds paid in silver. To offset this imbalance, the British started pushing opium into China that they sourced from India. With their defeat in the First Opium War, the Chinese were compelled to cede Hong Kong to the British and open five other treaty ports to international trade.",
    "They soon had to offer the same terms to the other western imperialists.",
    "\r\nDuring the Second Opium War in 1860, the British chastened the Chinese by raising Beijing's Summer Palace to the ground. ",
    "The ruthless pillage of the palace that contained a gargantuan number of priceless artifacts was to psychologically bludgeon the Chinese into submission.",
    "The decades that followed seared the Chinese ego further. China lost one third of of its territory to invasions  and tens of millions Chinese perished in internal conflict. The second World War left another thirty-five million Chinese dead.",
    "Many scholars hold that the Chinese Communist Party has cynically perpetuated the ‘shame’ narrative to subserve its own ends.",
    "However, the fact is that this ignominy was painfully felt even by the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who inscribed the words ‘avenge humiliation’ on every page of his diary for twenty long years. ",
    "Therefore, a failure to discern how central the spectre of humiliation is to the whole idea of modern China would entail making strategic and tactical miscalculations.",
    "However, no country can base its present on historical injustices and humiliations, howsoever traumatic they might have been. If China suffered one hundred years of humiliation at the hands of Western imperialists, India experienced 1300 years of dishonour at the hands of foreign invaders, beginning with Muhammad bin Qasim in 705 AD and ending with the British in 1947.",
    "Can or should this become India’s raison d'être in its dealings with its neighbours? The answer is no. India has not even been vociferous in demanding reparations from the British for 200 years of rapaciousness if you take the Battle of Plassey in 1957 as the inflection point.",
    "China needs to come out of its persecution complex. There is another problem of how China perceives itself vis-à-vis India. From 1911 to 1949, China went through a murderous civil war and a brutal conflict with the Japanese before the ‘Communist Shangri-La' could be established.",
    "Subsequently, it went through the murderous experiments of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural revolution.",
    "Conversely, the establishment of a liberal democracy in India was a relatively less bloody experience. It perhaps makes Chinese strategic planners wrongly assume that they are more resilient as a people in terms of their ability to take punishment as compared to us.",
    "It often makes me wonder what would have been the trajectory of our liberation movement if our overlords were the Japanese rather than the British. Imperial Japan was the most tyrannical power in the first 45 years of the 20th century before two atom bombs tamed them. However, we shall leave that for another day.",
    "Returning to the present: Are there any lessons that we need to draw from China’s self-flagellation narrative to fine tune our border strategy? The foremost is that even a weak China did not except the British overtures in 1899 when C M McDonald attempted to delineate India’s northern and China’s western border respectively.",
    "In 1913, they refused to sign off on the McMahon Line at the Simla Conference. From the Chinese point of view, the borders have remained fuzzy for over a century now. They have the patience to play the long game. We must be tenacious enough to go toe to toe and nose to nose.  ",
    "In 1993, an attempt was made in the Sino-Indian Peace and Tranquility agreement to establish the concept of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Its non-delineation on the map and non-demarcation on the ground, however, has rendered it virtually useless today.",
    "How then would this impasse substantively end even if the Corps Commander-level talks are temporarily able to arrive at a modus vivendi? It would only recede when the Chinese are made to realize by a concert of Asian powers that there will be no Middle Kingdom in the 21st Century. China cannot rise alone.",

The case fatality rate is 6.1 per cent due to the high viral load because of repeated exposure while treating patients. Twenty-five nurses and other healthcare providers have succumbed to the disease.",

    "The gaps in following precautions and misunderstanding the seriousness of the illness have also caused to lapses, leading to death.",
    "During the initial stages of pandemic, doctors were exposed to the virus while not having access to personal protection equipment, gloves, face shields and other secondary protective gears.",
    "These deaths also include those have been sudden and without any underlying illness. The deaths in those below 40 years of age are 21 per cent, below 50 years of age 29.6 per cent and below 60 years of age 55.5 per cent.",
    "Indian Medical Association data till April 29 showed that 927 doctors were infected with Covid-19, of whom 57 died. This data does not include small private hospitals and nursing homes, general physicians and those in the periphery of cities. The extensive work of compiling data with the help of colleagues and medical associations was carried out by Dr Rajeev Jayadevan.",
    "The data showed that young doctors too succumbed to Covid-19. Why they suffered from severe Covid-19 is not clear.",
    "Dr K.K. Aggarwal, past president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), said “The high viral load in doctors could lead to clotting of blood which is not understood. After noting the cases of rapid deterioration, oxygen levels are being checked. This is helping identify those who need to be isolated in case the oxygen levels are low.”",
    "The highest risk factor has been noted in operation theatres and it requires extensive management in terms of limited healthcare professionals.",
    "Dr Narsinga Reddy, national vice-president of IMA, explained, “The mild cases of non-Covid have to be managed online for some more time. The rotational duty system for doctors and healthcare workers is giving them time to rest. This has helped in controlling the numbers. Despite that the infection rate in doctors is a cause of concern.”",
    "It has been noted that aerosols in hospital the set-up apart from a suspected and positive Covid-19 patient could also be transmitted from an asymptomatic doctor who is not aware of the condition."

During the launch, Thackeray expressed his disapproval over several industries sacking workers at a time when the government is allowing resumption of business activities in the state.",

    "“The sons of the soil or the migrant workers, who had not returned to their states and were reporting at workplaces, are being sacked. This is not right,” the chief minister said, adding that the issue needs to be discussed with industrialists as the state government is trying to resolve difficulties that they are facing. The MahaJobs portal is the need of the hour, he said.",
    "Thackeray asked the authorities to take a regular stock of how useful the portal turns out in terms of the number of applicants actually getting jobs using the online platform, which will be run by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation. The portal’s launch was attended by the state industries minister Subhash Desai, labour minister Dilip Walse Patil, skill development minister Nawab Malik and minister of state for industries Aditi Tatkare via video conferencing.",

    "The life of Sarala (name changed), 58, from Piduguralla in Andhra Pradesh, has changed for the worse due to the lack of medical attention in April and May. During this time, her lung infection worsened into a life-threatening condition, which required difficult and expensive treatment. Though she has recovered, her lungs have been damaged and she will have to depend on an oxygen concentrator and BiPAP machine for the rest of her life. A BiPAP or Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure delivers pressurised air through a mask.",
    " ",
    "Sarala had developed the infection in early April. She had trouble breathing, and was always tired. She would sleep much more than usual. Her daughter Anuradha (name changed) said, “There were days when she would sleep for 20 hours in a day.”",
    "Sarala’s family tried consulting with a local doctor in Piduguralla but he was in home quarantine after having recently returned from abroad. A local hospital was sealed off after a COVID-19 case was reported there. For over a month, the family had no doctor or hospital available.",
    "By the end of May, the Andhra Pradesh government eased some restrictions on intra-state movement. The couple’s son, who lived in Uppal, Hyderabad, tried to get an e-pass to go home. His request was denied by the Telangana police. Some relatives helped Sarala get to Guntur, but hospitals there wouldn’t admit her without a COVID-19 test.",
    "On May 27, Sarala underwent a test at the Government General Hospital at Guntur and it retuned negative. The hospital said she would have to give a swab again since the testing machine had malfunctioned. She tested negative a second time on May 30.",
    "By this time, Sarala’s condition had worsened so much that she started experiencing delirium. Her blood oxygen level, according to the family, was less than 40 mmHg (values under 90 are considered low) and carbon dioxide levels were dangerously high. The family hired an ambulance to Hyderabad. The negative COVID-19 test secured her a bed at a corporate hospital in Secunderabad.",
    "Srikanth (name changed), Sarala’s son-in-law, said, “The doctors told us that we had delayed too long. They told us she had less than a 50 per cent chance of survival.” Sarala’s lung had to be drained of fluid. She was in the ICU for over two weeks.",
    "Sarala’s husband, while waiting on her at the hospital, suffered a stroke. A surgery was performed on him in the same hospital to place a coronary stent. They were discharged by June 13. The cost of hospitalisation was around Rs 8 lakh, most of it uninsured.",
    "Living with her son in Uppal now, Sarala is forced to use an oxygen concentrator or BiPAP machine at all times, both of which are expensive to rent or buy. Anuradha said, “She can take them off for just a couple of hours a day. If she doesn’t use them, her oxygen levels fall.” She can no longer play with her grandchildren or even walk without getting tired.",
    "Sarala’s family has no complaints against the hospitals and doctors but they believe that had there been more coordination during the lockdown and less confusion, Sarala might have been in a better shape. Srikanth said, “It was a systemic failure. All the organs of the state that were supposed to help us stopped working.”"

However, the Centre later asked the NIA to probe the case.",

Investigation also revealed that certain officials of Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi were in constant touch with Mir who was provided with funds to organize seminars in J-K to mobilize the masses against the Government of India”.",

    ": The Indian government is reviewing around 50 investment proposals involving Chinese companies under a new screening policy, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.",

China is the biggest of these investors and the rules drew criticism from Chinese investors and Beijing, which called the policy discriminatory.",

However, industry executives say a deterioration in bilateral relations since a clash along the countries’ contested border last month, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, could further delay approvals.",
