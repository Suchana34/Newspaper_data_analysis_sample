    "The move has created an urgent dilemma for thousands of international students, including Indians, who were stranded in the US last spring after the coronavirus forced their schools to move online. ",
    "What do the rules say?",
    "* The US immigration and custom enforcement (ICE) said: Non-immigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States.\" ",
    "* Active students currently in the United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status.

    "* The guidance does not affect students taking classes in person. ",
    "* It also does not affect F-1 students taking a partial online course-load, as long as their university certifies the student's instruction is not completely digital. ",
    "* M-1 vocational program students and F-1 English language training program students will not be allowed to take any classes online. ",

    "* Of particular concern is a stipulation saying students, including Indians, won't be exempt from the rules even if an outbreak forces their schools online during the fall term. It's unclear what would happen if a student ended up in that scenario but faced travel restrictions from their home country. ",
    "Most universities indecisive so far",
    "* International travel restrictions in place due to the pandemic have made it increasingly difficult for foreign students in the US to return to their home countries, while those outside America are uncertain if they will be able to travel to join their courses in American colleges and universities.

    "* Reacting to the latest US move, Harvard University President Larry Bacow expressed deep concern and said the new guidance issued imposed a \"blunt, one-size-fits-all approach to a complex problem giving international students, particularly those in online programmes, few options beyond leaving the country or transferring schools.\" ",
    "* US Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted that “kicking international students out of the US during a global pandemic because their colleges are moving classes online for physical distancing hurts students. It's senseless, cruel, and xenophobic. @ICEgov and @DHSgov must drop this policy immediately.” ",
    "* New York-based immigration attorney Cyrus Mehta tweeted that “students who attend schools that operate completely online will not be allowed to receive F-1 visas or enter in F-1 status or maintain F-1 status in the fall 2020 semester. So Trump is forcing foreign students to study in unsafe conditions during COVID-19.” ",
    "Trump's hard stance on foreigners",
    "* While cracking down on immigration is one of his key issues, Trump has taken a particularly hard stance on foreigners since the health crisis began. ",

    "HDFC",
    ". But the Chinese central bank also holds stakes in several other listed companies. However, these are all below the radar since they are less than the 1% threshold limit for open disclosures by companies (see graphic). Among others, PBoC holds a 0.32% stake in cement sector major Ambuja Cement, and 0.43% in Piramal Enterprises, which has a major presence in the pharma sector. ",
    "PBoC’s holding in HDFC is currently worth about Rs 3,100 crore, while in Piramal Enterprises around Rs 137 crore, and in Ambuja Cement about Rs 122 crore. Exactly two years ago, the Chinese central bank had received RBI permission to set shop here. Two recent reports on Chinese investments in India have warned that several funds and investment companies, directly controlled or indirectly influenced by its government, have been eyeing stakes in companies that are strategically important to the economy. ",
    "India-China stand-off: Complete coverage",
    "Till 2019, PBoC also had a small stake in a company that’s a major player in the game of chances, but the bank exited that company some months ago. Market sources said the Chinese central bank also has stakes in several other companies, including in the Indian arm of a German manufacturing major and another domestic fertilisers major. But these are not disclosed publicly since they all are below the 1% limit. ",
    "Ambuja Cement’s annual report for 2019 showed PBoC held nearly 63 lakh shares in the cement major. Of these, the bank acquired about 16 lakh shares by buying small chunks through 2019. In Piramal Enterprises, PBoC increased its stake early this year to 0.43% when the company went for a rights offer. “This marginal increase in their holding (in terms of number of shares) is largely on account of PBoC’s participation in our rights issue,” a spokesperson for the group said. ",
    "Ladakh stand-off: How India also waged a diplomatic war against China",
    "After PBoC’s stake acquisition in HDFC came to light on April 12, the government, through a press note on April 17, amended foreign investment rules into India. The addition was that any investment from an entity from a country that shares “a land border with India” will require government’s approval. Earlier, such restrictions were applicable to investments from Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the April 17 note included investments from China as well. ",
    "India, China begin disengagement after talks between NSA Doval, Chinese foreign minister",
    "In the recent past, some developed jurisdictions have amended foreign investment policies to weed out opportunistic takeovers of strategically important and other domestic companies when valuations are low, as Covid-19-related issues are weighing on stock prices. India has not gone as far as these countries, but China-watchers say it should be on guard. According to a leading Sinologist, there is an old Chinese tactic called “loot a burning house”. “The government policymakers should remember this while formulating the FDI policies.” ",
    "A recent Brookings Institute report also put out caveats along similar lines for Indian policymakers, especially regulators for investments into India. The March 2020 report said that the growth of Chinese investments into India since 2014 has changed the nature of what has been a largely transactional trade relationship. ",
    "“Chinese companies are emerging as prominent players and investors, in areas ranging from infrastructure and energy to newer sectors of interest such as technology startups and real estate,” Ananth Krishnan, the author of the report, said. Drawing on several sources within India and from China, the report said that the aggregate Chinese investment in India was a staggering $26 billion with a pledge to ",
    "invest",
    " another $15 billion in major infrastructure projects. However, these figures are likely an underestimation since there are several limitations to exactly map Chinese investments in India, especially given the reluctance of the Chinese government to share the data. ",
    "Another report by Gateway House, a foreign relations think tank, pointed out how Chinese companies were using the startup route to invest in leading players in several sectors in India. The list includes investments by Alibaba in Paytm group, Zomato and others and by Tencent in Byju’s, ",

  ],
  "content": [
    "While the Indian cricket team has always boasted of world-class players and has given some of the most brilliant players to the cricketing world, there is something endearing about the grey-haired, camouflage-lover former Indian skipper. Yes, we are talking about MS Dhoni, fondly known as Captain Cool, who is celebrating is 39th birthday today. Even though the cricketer is far from his prime, fans across the world continue to wait to witness his helicopter shots and lightning-fast wicket-keeping on the field \n\n",
    "\n",
    "Dhoni: A man of few words and thousand emotions ",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A man of few words, Dhoni is known to turn away from the camera, when emotions get too overwhelming for him to contain. Away from limelight and all the glory surrounding the coveted trophies, he can be seen silently smiling at the achievements from the corner in most photographs. Not a lot was known about Mahi’s personal life, as he is lovingly called by his millions of fans, before his movie, ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’ came out in the year 2016. Former skipper’s role was played to perfection by late actor Sushant Singh Rajput and both of them were reported to have bonded really well during the course of the shoot. \n",
    "\n\n",
    "Dhoni’s mental state after Sushant’s untimely demise ",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It was believed that Sushant used to hurl an array of never-ending questions at Dhoni, to get to the skin of the character, leaving even the uber-cool captain slightly annoyed. The photographs of two of them bonding and giving interviews during the promotions of the movie once again went viral after the heartbreaking news of Sushant’s death on 14, June 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "While most of the Bollywood celebrities and those belonging to the cricketing fraternity have shared poignant wishes for the actor par brilliance who died by suicide, people were also waiting for Dhoni to share his grief with the world. However, the cricketer opted for a deafening silence-- no statements, no social media posts --which provided a glimpse of how he dealt with traumatic events in life. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection between going silent after trauma ",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every person has a different method of coping with a traumatic or a significantly life-changing event. While some may stay cooped up inside their shell for days, not choosing to talk to anyone or staying in a state of complete denial, others may find themselves getting angry at how things have turned out. No matter how you choose to grieve, it is important to understand that grief is universal and different people grieve differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, when Dhoni went silent after the news of Kai Po Che actor’s sudden demise, it sheds light on his way of coping with the heartbreaking news. Disbelief and shock are one of the known reactions of dealing with traumatic and disturbing life events. This is because any such shocking event confuses our mind and we find it very difficult to believe that it has actually happened. As a result, we are not in any position to react to how it makes us feel.\n",

So, I've had some special memories with the musical franchise. To be honest, I definitely can't fill the shoes of the legends who were judging this season prior to the lockdown, but I will judge the show in my own style. I am very emotional towards kids, so while taking care of their feelings, we will take the show ahead. In fact, Alka, Himesh and I already have a great rapport and connection, so we will surely have a great time. I know that the shoot system won't be normal and it will be a whole new level of experience, but I feel everyone is very mature to make sure the safety of the kids and each member is in place.

Being a mentor on the show several times, returning to Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Li'l Champs is like a homecoming for me after the immensely successful season of Li'l Champs in 2017 that had a record run of 8 months and was the top-rated singing reality show of the year. I am looking forward to a fresh start with the current season of the show post this lockdown and I hope we receive a tremendous response. We have an array of exceptionally talented young singers from across the country who have proven themselves to be great performers with their incredible passion and skill for music, so am sure this season will see some fantastic acts.\"\n",

    "coronavirus",
    " can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air, infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence suggests. ",
    "This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help explain superspreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. ",
    "Coronavirus: Live updates",
    "It's unclear how often the virus is spread via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. ",
    "Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Marr and more than 200 other experts, who have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization. ",
    "What is clear, they said, is that people should consider minimizing time indoors with people outside their families. Schools, nursing homes and businesses should consider adding powerful new air filters and ultraviolet lights that can kill ",
    "airborne viruses",
    ". ",
    "Here are answers to a few questions raised by the latest research. ",
    "What does it mean for a virus to be airborne?",
    "For a virus to be airborne means that it can be carried through the air in a viable form. For most pathogens, this is a yes-no scenario. HIV, too delicate to survive outside the body, is not airborne. Measles is airborne, and dangerously so: It can survive in the air for up to two hours. ",
    "For the coronavirus, the definition has been more complicated. Experts agree that the virus does not travel long distances or remain viable outdoors. But evidence suggests it can traverse the length of a room and, in one set of experimental conditions, remain viable for perhaps three hours. ",
    "How are aerosols different from droplets?",
    "Aerosols are droplets, droplets are aerosols — they do not differ except in size. Scientists sometimes refer to droplets fewer than 5 microns in diameter as aerosols. (By comparison, a red blood cell is about 5 microns in diameter; a human hair is about 50 microns wide.) ",
    "From the start of the pandemic, the WHO and other public health organizations have focused on the virus's ability to spread through large droplets that are expelled when a symptomatic person coughs or sneezes. ",
    "These droplets are heavy, relatively speaking, and fall quickly to the floor or onto a surface that others might touch. This is why public health agencies have recommended maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from others, and frequent hand washing. ",
    "But some experts have said for months that infected people also are releasing aerosols when they cough and sneeze. More important, they expel aerosols even when they breathe, talk or sing, especially with some exertion. ",
    "Scientists know now that people can spread the virus even in the absence of symptoms — without coughing or sneezing — and aerosols might explain that phenomenon. ",
    "Because aerosols are smaller, they contain much less virus than droplets do. But because they are lighter, they can linger in the air for hours, especially in the absence of fresh air. In a crowded indoor space, a single infected person can release enough aerosolized virus over time to infect many people, perhaps seeding a superspreader event. ",
    "For droplets to be responsible for that kind of spread, a single person would have to be within a few feet of all the other people, or to have contaminated an object that everyone else touched. All that seems unlikely to many experts: \"I have to do too many mental gymnastics to explain those other routes of transmission compared to aerosol transmission, which is much simpler,\" Marr said. ",
    "Can I stop worrying about physical distancing and washing my hands?",
    "Physical distancing is still very important. The closer you are to an infected person, the more aerosols and droplets you may be exposed to. Washing your hands often is still a good idea. ",
    "What's new is that those two things may not be enough. \"We should be placing as much emphasis on masks and ventilation as we do with hand washing,\" Marr said. \"As far as we can tell, this is equally important, if not more important.\" ",
    "Should I begin wearing a hospital-grade mask indoors? And how long is too long to stay indoors? ",
    "Health care workers may all need to wear N95 masks, which filter out most aerosols. At the moment, they are advised to do so only when engaged in certain medical procedures that are thought to produce aerosols. ",
    "For the rest of us, cloth face masks will still greatly reduce risk, as long as most people wear them. At home, when you're with your own family or with roommates you know to be careful, masks are still not necessary. But it is a good idea to wear them in other indoor spaces, experts said. ",
    "As for how long is safe, that is frustratingly tough to answer. A lot depends on whether the room is too crowded to allow for a safe distance from others and whether there is fresh air circulating through the room. ",
    "What does airborne transmission mean for reopening schools and colleges?",
    "This is a matter of intense debate. Many schools are poorly ventilated and are too poorly funded to invest in new filtration systems. \"There is a huge vulnerability to infection transmission via aerosols in schools,\" said Don Milton, an aerosol expert at the University of Maryland. ",
    "Most children younger than 12 seem to have only mild symptoms, if any, so elementary schools may get by. \"So far, we don't have evidence that elementary schools will be a problem, but the upper grades, I think, would be more likely to be a problem,\" Milton said. ",
    "College dorms and classrooms are also cause for concern. ",
    "Milton said the government should think of long-term solutions for these problems. Having public schools closed \"clogs up the whole economy, and it's a major vulnerability,\" he said. ",
    "\"Until we understand how this is part of our national defense, and fund it appropriately, we're going to remain extremely vulnerable to these kinds of biological threats.\" ",

    "But even outdoors, wear a mask if you are likely to be close to others for an extended period. ",
    "When indoors, one simple thing people can do is to \"open their windows and doors whenever possible,\" Marr said. You can also upgrade the filters in your home air-conditioning systems, or adjust the settings to use more outdoor air rather than recirculated air. ",
    "Public buildings and businesses may want to invest in air purifiers and ultraviolet lights that can kill the virus. Despite their reputation, elevators may not be a big risk, Milton said, compared with public bathrooms or offices with stagnant air where you may spend a long time. ",

    "coronavirus",
    " will be insufficient to stay in the US and could result in their visa being invalidated unless they transfer to institutions that offer in-person courses. ",
    "The notification by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) of the ",
    "Immigration",
    " and Customs Enforcement bureau sent shock waves through the more than one million foreign students in USA, including 200,000 Indians and 400,000 Chinese who form the top two contingents. Thousands of students are already grappling with disruption caused by the pandemic, ranging from housing issues to having to take virtual or online courses that many schools have switched to even within the US, even though they have paid fees upfront for in-person classroom learning. ",
    "As per the ICE notification, non-immigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States starting September. The US Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will US Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States, notification says. ",
    "\"Active students currently in the United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status. If not, they may face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings,\" the ICE notification warns. ",
    "The notification also clarifies that foreign students attending schools adopting a hybrid model—that is, a mixture of online and in person classes—will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Non-immigrant Student Status,” certifying that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program. ",
    "The notification was roundly condemned by many educators, student bodies, and civil liberty activists, some of whom saw a darker design by the Trump administration to block yet another immigration route that is widely seen as having benefited America, while delivering a body blow to the country’s academia that has also been enriched by foreign students. The move to choke foreign student entry to the U.S came after immigration hardliners failed last month to end the optional training program that some of them see as foreigners taking away “American jobs.” ",
    "“ICE is now trying to deport students enrolled in colleges and universities that are teaching exclusively online due to Covid-19. This is needlessly cruel and must be challenged in court,” Julian Castro, a former Obama administration said, while the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) accused the administration of exploiting the pandemic “to target even more people, simply because they are immigrants.” ",
    "Meanwhile, foreign students, already harried by the disruption, including the inability to go home during the summer break because of lack of flights, discussed the difficulties in continuing virtual education from their home country – from spotty internet connection to having to log in at odd hours (if they lived in a diametrically different time zone), not to speak of incongruity of ponying up top dollar for online courses instead of in-person instruction and practical training. ",
    "Some academic and American students began exploring ways to facilitate foreign students meeting the ICE metrics and staying in the US, including one Harvard professor who offered an “in-person masked course” titled \"What Pandemic? How the White House confronted international students more aggressively than the virus.” ",
    "In some ways, Indian students -- who form the second largest cohort of 200,000 foreign students after China's 400,000 -- are collateral damage to the Trump hardliners' suspicion of Chinese students and academics. Nationalist REpublican lawmakers such as Senator Tom Cotton have explicitly called for banning Chinese students from STEM courses in the US, saying they spy on and spirit out breakthroughs and technology for their home country.

His entrepreneurial dairy business was carried forward by his sons and in the year 1950, Raghunath Chitale established the brand that now has many loyal customers in India and across the globe. This was the time when the Chitale brothers were jointly managing the fledging milk retailing network in the state along with the growing confectionery chain. Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale grew tremendously in a short span of time and its steady growth led to the establishment of manufacturing and retail outlets for mithai and snacks as well. Bakarwadi and mango burfi (also known as amba burfi) became the most sought after products by the brand, with their uniqueness captivating the imagination of culinary connoisseurs across the world.\n\n",

    "Today, the legendary confectioner is run by the fourth generation of the family that is combining its entrepreneurial skills and new age innovative strategies to scale the heights of their business. In the year 2000, with a Master’s Degree in Commerce, Kedar Chitale joined the family business, and the fourth generation picked up the baton. By this time, Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale was already a name synonymous to the very identity of Maharashtrians and Kedar carried this legacy forward. Until this time, the Chitales sold out whatever they produced through their two outlets in Pune. With new innovations, machinery and automation in their manufacturing plants, the production increased exponentially and with it came the need for marketing and distribution. Rajabhau, Kedar’s grandfather had appointed a manager for marketing and distribution outside Pune, but he decided to assign distribution responsibilities in Pune within the family. Distribution and marketing were new to this business, but Rajabhau took the challenge head-on and recruited Kedar to help him establish the marketing and distribution network in Pune.\n",
    "\n",
    "As demand for Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale products grew across Pune, Kedar appointed franchisees across Pune in neighbourhoods like Aundh, Baner, Kalyani Nagar, Waraje, Hadapsar, NIBM Road and Nigdi. After the IT boom in Pune and the influx of people from all corners of India who had developed a taste for Chitales' delicacies, he set up small outlets at places like Infosys, Dell, Zencer, TCS and the Eon IT Park. Even the departure lounges at Mumbai and Pune airports opened Chitale outlets and saw an enthusiastic response from the customers. Currently, Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale has 20 Franchises in Pune, outlets in many IT hubs, and five new innovative stores called Chitale Xpress. The products are now also available in 5 continents around the globe and all over the country through the strong distributor and supply chain network developed under his leadership. Kedar Chitale was the first in his generation to shoulder the weight of the Chitale legacy, and paved the way for his brothers to follow.\n",

    "With a degree in electronic and telecommunications, another fourth-generation Chitale, Indraneel, was trained to be an engineer. However, he discovered his calling was in marketing, product and business development. In 2011, Indraneel formally joined the business and sought a role in product and business development. On the suggestion of his father Sanjay and his uncle Shree, he was assigned the responsibility of manufacturing and production. After training for a year under his father, he went to the Netherlands for training with GEA Group, one of the largest suppliers in the food processing industry. This is where he learnt how machines are conceived, designed, built and commissioned. Upon returning to Pune in 2012, the first project that he undertook and successfully ran was automating the crate washing process. He has special machinery imported from Denmark to wash and dry the crates used for transportation of the products from the factory to the outlets. He then went out to automate the processes for a majority of products manufactured under the Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale banner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indraneel has since then taken the task of automating most products that Chitale Bandhu manufacture like Ladoos, Pedhas, Namkeens, Burfis, Katalis, Modaks and the erstwhile Bakarwadi. Along with product automation, Indraneel also focussed on process automation where from procurement to purchase, the entire supply chain is tracked and monitored in an automated environment with data analytics and artificial intelligence helping the brand deliver the freshest product in the shortest amount of time to the customer across 5 states and export markets across the world.

    "In the last few months, the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic has transformed business for the food industry in India and across the globe. There is a huge impetus on these companies to reduce the risk of transmission by introducing new protocols on hygiene and safety. At a time like this, Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale has geared up for the new normal by adding a slew of changes in its plants, retail outlets, and distribution systems. The brand started its operations after the lockdown was lifted by adding new protocols to its already strong hygiene practices. Whether it is strict thermal checking at the point of entry, sanitation, heightened social distancing, or educating workers, it is ensuring uncompromised safety. By revising the standard operating procedures at its factory, Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale is also being able to replicate the same at its retail outlets, distribution channels, and online delivery systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automation has always been a core principle at the brand’s plant, with almost 80% of the products like barfis, ladoos, pedhas, katlis, and Bakarwadi produced in an automated environment. The reliance on automation makes the plant more machine intensive than labour intensive, reducing the chances of contamination during cross handling by a great degree. Thus, the products are manufactured and packaged in a safe environment before being sent out to retail outlets. With no packaging done outside the factory, customers can purchase safe packages at the outlets where workers follow strict hygiene practices by wearing masks, hand gloves, and shields. To limit contact and encourage people to practice social distancing norms, it is also carrying out online delivery of its products across the country. \n",

While keeping in mind the brand legacy, existing consumer base and brand values, Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale is now coming up with some new and unique innovations in products. Innovation in traditional sweets such as Soanpapdi and Modaks by adding flavours to the existing variants has proven to be a great hit among the consumers. Chilli Guava Soanpapdi, Royal Anjeer Soanpapdi, Chatpata Mango Soanpapdi, Blueberry Soanpapdi, Cranberry Soanpapdi, Blueberry Modak, Cranberry Modak, etc. are some of the examples which are widely in demand and are not produced by any other brand.\n",

These innovations have been done keeping in mind the young audience and their consumption habits and ‘on the go’ lifestyle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chitale Bandhu Mithaiwale has also found a way to increase the shelf life of the earlier easily perishable mithais without adding harmful artificial preservatives and also maintaining the quality and the original taste that is loved by all. The average shelf life of the mithais is now anywhere between 30-40 days which earlier was around 5-7 days at the most.

    "NEW DELHI",
    ": Over the course of 22 years, ",
    "Honda City",
    " has emerged as a front-runner in the segment, reaching over 8 lakh houses. Come 2020, City is bigger and bolder. We drove and reviewed it last week but it's time to measure how comfortable interiors of the new City are. ",
    "The fifth-generation Honda City launching on July 15 is based on the concept of “Ambitious sedan,” the new City is now bigger and better than ever. Playing largely on the interiors of the new sedan, Honda has introduced a suite of new features. ",
    "For the new ‘ambitious’ City, the interior has been completely reworked. As you step inside the new City, the first thing you will notice is the ample space it offers. All thanks to the improved length of the car. ",
    "12:43",
    "2020 Honda City review",
    "Metallic embellishment in the AC outlet knobs and speaker area make in the interiors even more attractive. Maintaining its signature theme, the City comes with an updated dashboard in three layers with a faux-wooden strip running across the front panel. Plenty of soft-touch points shadow the usage of plastic in the dash. Overall it does offer a sense of durability. ",
    "Honda has proactively updated the seven-inch LCD TFT screen. Touch and feel are much improved and slick to operate. Apart from that, Honda has added 32 connected features as part of the latest Honda Connect App which includes Geo-fencing, live car location, service scheduler, tire deflation alert. ",
    "Interior of the new Honda City",
    "With the increased connectivity, Honda City is now the first Alexa-enabled car in the country. However, ",
    "Hyundai Verna",
    " has the upper hand in the segment, when it comes to overall features. ",
    "Back in late-90s, when Maruti and Hyundai were busy making entry-level hatchbacks, ",
    "Honda Cars",
    " introduced City. The sedan, since then, has become as synonymous as the brand in the country. ",
    "Practicality inside the car has also been improved by providing storage spaces all around the car. A smartphone tray has been installed to the central console along with the usage of a compact thin electric type heater control unit. Also, the front floor center console is equipped with 2 cup holders. Each of the doors and rear armrest has a bottle or a cup holder. New sub-pockets have been installed inside the seatback pocket to be able to store the smartphones more conveniently. ",
    "In the centre, you get a leather stitched armrest which opens up to store a considerable amount of stuff. Unlike its prime rival Hyundai Verna, the new City does not sport a vent in its glovebox to keep the beverages cool. ",
    "When it comes to comfort, Honda has never let down. In the new City, you get cushioned seats, great side support and a larger headrest. The rear seat’s comfort has been improved drastically which now optimizes the torso angle. The front seats have been made rounder and shaped at the shoulder area to secure a better sitting comfort and increase the ability to hold the passenger in place. The driver seat has also been improved to have a better driving visibility and pedal position to reduce driver’s stress. ",
    "Second row of the new Honda City",
    "While the reworked instrument panel provides greater knee room for the driver, the rear-seat legroom has been improved with an increase of 27mm easily affording three people in the second row. ",
    "That said, the front seats in the ",
    "5th generation Honda City",
    " lack a ventilation facility, which is available in Hyundai Verna. ",
    "For the first time in its segment, Honda City has adopted a two dials meter with a large 7-inch color TFT LCD panel. ",
    "The new City comes with an updated air conditioning switch called “MAX COOL” which can be set to the lowest temperature by just a single switch. Honda has worked massively on improving rear-seat comfort by increasing the airflow of more than 12% compared to the current model. ",
    "Launching into the market on July 15, City in its 5th generation is a charm. Honda Cars India would wish to turn the tide with the new City in a Covid-plagued market. ",

The crisis is “much worse from an economic impact” point of view compared to what the industry had suffered during the global financial meltdown of 2008-09. ",
    "Also, on-site personnel deployment outside India will come down and software teams will increasingly work out of India, Tech Mahindra MD & CEO C P Gurnani said. “There will clearly be a slowdown. The question is how long and how much? The slowdown is inevitable,” Gurnani told TOI Dialogues in a special series on the Indian IT industry and the impact of the coronavirus. ",

    "Top 10 Dialogues of CP Gurnani at TOI Dialogues: Rise of Digital Economy",
    "The Tech Mahindra boss said, “There will be a lag, and that lag will hit the economy. My belief is that it is already hurting us... So, there will be a drop in the revenues.” ",
    "Tech Mahindra has over 1.2 lakh employees and gets a large part of its business from markets across Europe and the US, apart from India. ",
    "Gurnani said that while the focus on network and services, and media and entertainment will keep the situation under control for Tech Mahindra, there are other areas where companies may find the going tough for a few quarters. ",
    "“I don’t want to be negative, but everyone knows that the businesses are impacted. If a motorcycle manufacturer is not manufacturing motorcycles, he is not going to give me a new transformation project. If you do not fly, clearly the airline industry is not going to give me a new project. So, it is clear that there will be a slowdown.” ",
    "Gurnani said that there will be two quarters of stress if the second wave (of the pandemic) is not very strong. “Of course, all of us will live in suspense till a vaccine is discovered. My best estimate at this stage is that October onwards, there will be a recovery in Indian IT and the global IT spends.” ",
    "Speaking about cyber security, Gurnani said that there is a need to be vigilant against fraudsters, hackers and online criminals. “I don’t think we take cyber security seriously enough. My personal belief is that the next wave of panic can only come through cyber security lapses and all of us need to be prepared for it.” ",
    "Asked whether India is under-prepared in terms of cyber security, he said, “… if you choose not to be prepared, and take it lightly, then it is a serious threat. Your risk management policy should prepare you for that highest risk.” "

However, he said that while the company conserves cash, it will not be cutting jobs or salaries. ",
    "“The plants are not fully functional as yet, as we are working in single shift, with a smaller number of people. We are not operating all assembly lines, and are maintaining a safe distance. This naturally brings down our production and productivity,” Munjal said at the opening session of TOI Dialogues, a unique leadership summit (The topic for Tuesday’s TOI Dialogues was business continuity in the times of Covid).

    "Hero MotoCorp had said a few months ago that the company was looking to invest as much as Rs 10,000 crore towards model launches, new technologies, and capacity augmentation. Munjal said that some of these investments may now be deferred. “We are paying salaries, and taking care of our overheads in a shutdown when we are not making any revenues. The most important thing for the organisation now is to conserve cash. Cash is very precious, and so investments do take a back seat.” ",
    "Munjal said that investments that were already in progress would be completed. “… we haven’t stopped that. But where we did not start, we definitely stopped… We will definitely defer expansion in Halol (Gujarat) plant and new investments in Andhra Pradesh facility.” ",
    "The company does not see the need to produce more when demand is expected to stay weak. “For this fiscal, the total sales will probably be lower than what we had expected previously. Thus, why would we go there and put in investments that will stand still and give no returns?” ",
    "Apart from a cut in GST, Munjal said that the government should also look at reducing dividend tax. “People will then have the ability to give higher dividends and put more money in the hands of the consumers.” ",
