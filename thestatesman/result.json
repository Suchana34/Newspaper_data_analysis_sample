    "Seventy-three years after independence, the majestic Rohtang tunnel will unlock the fate of tribal folks in Lahaul valley in the cold desert of Lahaul Spiti district in Himachal Pradesh.",
    "The 8.8 kilometre long tunnel is set to be operational in September this year and will give all weather connectivity to Lahaul that remained cut off from the rest of the world for almost six months through winters every year, following heavy snow on 13050 feet high Rohtang Pass.",

    "It was a challenging job for the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) to dig up an all-weather tunnel in the toughest of terrain. The project that took off on ground ten years back hit many roadblocks because of harsh weather all these years.",

    "She revealed that pregnant women faced much difficulty in winters in an emergency as there were no specialists in Keylong hospital and subsidised chopper flights to tribal belts were uncertain.",
    "The feeling is echoed by the tribals from different walks of life as they had to spend virtually half of their lives landlocked in Lahaul due to snow every winter, or afford a house in adjacent Kullu to live a comfortable life.",
    "Over the years, there has been a slow exodus from Lahaul with more and more people looking for greener pastures outside the tribal area due to tough conditions back home.",
    "In the 2011 census, Lahaul Spiti district of Himachal had shown a negative decadal growth rate of population (- 5.0 per cent from 2001-2011), with migration from the area cited as one of the main reasons for this.",
    "The locals in Lahaul feel that once the tunnel is operational, it will boost the local development and economy, and may ultimately help in reverse migration.",
    "‚ÄúThis will bring tourism and help in related progress, right from roads to infrastructure. We can promote winter tourism in a big way in Lahaul,‚Äù said Tsering, 39, who runs a food joint in Keylong.",
    "The officials in Lahaul say the all-weather connectivity will help in overall mainstreaming of the area.",
    "‚ÄúPeople had to go out for good education; medical facilities etc. Generally the government employees don‚Äôt want to join in the tribal area because of harsh conditions and lack of basic facilities. The round-the-year connectivity will lead to better education and health care services in Lahaul and improve attendance in the government offices also,‚Äù they said."

    "Law should not remain dormant, while those who defy it go scot free and those who seek its protection lose hope. If such a situation develops, it is the Rule of Law which becomes the first casualty, people‚Äôs faith in the system gets eroded and criminals have the last laugh.",
    "In our country, the criminal justice system suffers from such serious infirmities. With low rate of conviction of about 16 per cent, it opens hundreds of vistas for criminals to prolong and twist investigations, influence witnesses and even take repeated somersaults before trial courts.",
    "There have also been cases where under-trials have been incarcerated for periods longer than the punishment prescribed for their alleged offences due to quagmire of delays or faulty investigations. As per National Crime Record Bureau, about 67.2 per cent of prisoners are undertrials.",
    "While a few enjoy premature release because of good conduct during incarceration, others languish behind bars. There is no safeguard against the misuse of such powers as it rests upon the sole discretion of jail authorities. The recent premature release of Manu Sharma, awarded life imprisonment in the Jessica Lal murder case shows how the system works.",
    "The release has struck blows on the principle of equality before law in as much as no fair exercise was done by authorities to identify other similarly situated persons who should have been entitled to get similar release.",
    "It is already held by Supreme Court in Maru Ram Vs. Union of India and Another 1981 (1) SCR 1996 that life sentence is nothing less than life-long imprisonment. It makes it clear in several decided cases that ¬ëimprisonment for life lasts until the last breath.‚Äô",
    "However, in spite of such categorical propositions held by Supreme court, there are loopholes created in such a manner that a prisoner, even though awarded life imprisonment can get premature release and come out of jail after completing just 14 years of imprisonment.",
    "This provision has left scope for promoting favouritism and corruption without appropriate safeguards to prevent misuse of powers. As per provisions contained in Section 433 of Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, a State Government may commute the sentence of imprisonment for life for a term not exceeding fourteen years or for fine.",
    "Section 433 A of the same code lays down further that where a sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed on conviction of a person for an offence for which death is one of the punishments provided by law, or where a sentence of death imposed on a person has been commuted under Section 433 into one of imprisonment for life, such person shall not be released from prison unless he had served at least fourteen years of imprisonment.",
    "In case of woman prisoner, this period is at least 10 years. The procedure adopted for such premature release is that the Superintendent of Jail initiates the cases of prisoners who are eligible for release on the ground of their good conduct during incarceration and forwards the names to Deputy Commissioner of Police of the area where the crime was committed. He then ensures the reference of all such cases through Director General of Prisons before the Sentence Review Board.",
    "There is no safeguard against use or misuse of such a power vested with Superintendent of Jail and other authorities. No judicial remedy can be invoked as it is the sole discretion of government.",
    "This procedure of grant of premature release is in addition to the provisions contained in Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution wherein the President of India and the Governor of a State can grant pardon, reprieve or remission to the convict. In K.M.Nanawati Vs. State of Maharashtra, such a power was exercised when the accused Nanavati was pardoned by the than Governor Smt. Vijay Lakshmi Pandit and released after barely three years of incarceration.",
    "This evoked sharp reactions from all quarters and even the Supreme Court remarked that Governor had overreached her powers.",
    "Nanawati left this country to settle down in Canada. Thereafter, numerous such instances kept on making a mockery of the criminal justice system. Our criminal justice system suffers from growing pendency, marked by delayed and shoddy investigation. As per details laid on the table of Lok Sabha by the Law Minister, there are 59,867 cases pending with Supreme Court, 44.75 lac cases pending with High Courts and whopping 3.14 crore cases pending with District Courts all over the country as of November, 2019.",
    "The position of pendency in Tribunals is even more disturbing. This growing pendency is not merely due to large number of vacancies remaining un-filled but also because of our judicial system where either replies or rejoinders are not filed in time or adjournments are sought on one pretext or the other.",
    "Some time ago, a proposal was mooted for recruitment of Judges through Indian Judicial Service on the pattern of IAS and IPS. But even this proposal could not be implemented because judges who recommend appointments of judges do not want to be deprived of their privileges. Vacancies of judges across courts in India has affected their functioning. As of 2017, High Courts had 403 vacancies and subordinate courts had 5,676 vacancies.",
    "The vacancies for the post of public prosecutors are all the more alarming.",
    "The system is rotting also because Courts often pass acquittal orders with remarks that prosecution has failed to bring substantial evidence. They do not go to the extent of ordering re-investigations to see the truth coming forth which is their prime objective. Lack of protection of witnesses is another major roadblock. Instances of intimidating witnesses and recording depositions under fear or allurement are common and widespread.",
    "There are instances where witnesses were even murdered inside court compounds. There is no law yet to protect the witness and to punish the person trying to influence witnesses despite repeated recommendations by Law Commission. In U.K., intimidation of a witness is an offence punishable under law.",
    "On the basis of recommendations of Law Commission, a Witness Protection Bill, 2015 was introduced providing a comprehensive system for protecting witnesses. However, the Bill is yet to be passed. If witnesses are to depose under fear or intimidation or allurement, the foundations of justice are bound to be weakened. It is the need of the hour to ensure that the Witness Protection Bill, is enacted at the earliest.",
    "Criminalisation of politics and political patronage for criminals is another arena which has made the matters worse. Vohra Committee 1993 had suggested measures to curb criminalisation of politics. But its recommendations were not implemented. Jail reforms is another issue which forms part of the criminal justice system.",
    "Jails are no longer reformatories as instances of riots, crimes, entry of drugs, objectionable items, mobiles etc have increased. Irregularities in grant of parole, extra facilities during Open Jail periods against rules and immoral activities go un-checked. A committee on reforms in the Criminal Justice system was constituted by the Government of India vide its order dated 24 November 2000 under chairmanship of Justice V.S. Malimath to suggest measures for revamping the system. After a prolonged exercise, committee submitted its 297-page report on 28 March 2003 and offered valuable suggestions.",
    "However, the report has not received due consideration. It appears that there is lack of will to bring sweeping reforms in the criminal justice system. If no prompt action is taken to set it right, it is bound to cast its shadow on law and order and maintenance of peace in the society.",

    "Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister JAI RAM THAKUR, 55, is a five-time BJP MLA. In the middle of his tenure, Thakur, who also holds the health portfolio, has been dealing with the raging coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic in his state.",
    "A rising BJP star leader, Thakur recently faced a political row sparked by a scam involving bribery allegations against a state health department director in Covid PPE kits purchases that surfaced through an audio clip in May and led to resignation of the state BJP chief.",
    "However, an unfazed Thakur has continued to grapple with these challenges while seeking to steer the tiny, picturesque state through the Covid storm.",
    "Q) How do you assess the Covid-19 situation in Himachal Pradesh?",
    "\nCovid-19 cases in the country are increasing. The number of cases has unexpectedly risen in Himachal also, which is a matter of concern. But there is no community spread. Maximum positive cases have travel history, some from contacts, and in isolated cases the history is not known. See the case of Delhi, where Covid cases are spiralling every day. Compared to many other states in the country, we have done far better. We implemented the institutional and home quarantines forcefully.",
    "Q) Do you think the decision to bring large number of people from outside amid the Covid lockdown was judicious?",
    "\nHP could have become corona free in May first week with one active case left. But we had to act as per the conditions prevailing in the country. In a meeting with the Prime Minister, the Chief Ministers shared their concerns that people took long, long journeys ‚Äì even over 1,000 kilometres ‚Äì on foot, some with kids, to reach their homes within the country. Many were outside India. It was painful. The PM said that we will do whatever is to be done to check the spread of Covid-19, but in this hour of crisis, everyone wants to go home. This was an emotional decision. The CMs were asked to facilitate people in their states to arrive back comfortably. So we also did that and brought back more than two lakh people home, despite knowing that the Covid cases would increase.",
    "Q) Didn‚Äôt the government put 70 lakh people living in HP at risk for those two lakh arrivals?",
    "\nIt was a catch-22 situation. But the Himachalis outside Himachal were in serious trouble; they included a large number of people who had lost their jobs and had no resources to live on. It was the government‚Äôs responsibility to help them come back during lockdown on humanitarian grounds. The cases did increase, but we took precautions.",
    "Q) A widespread allegation is that your government brought people into the state without proper testing and quarantine mechanism at the border?",
    "\nHP had the best mechanism on the border for Covid-19 in the entire country. People who came from Delhi reached our border Parwanoo without any checks in Punjab, Haryana or Chandigarh territory. But they could not enter HP without proper check. It was not practical to quarantine people at the border, given their numbers, which were as high as 5,000 a day sometimes. They were quarantined in districts, based on the zone they came from. Tests were mandatory for all.",
    "Q) Why have you gone back to your earlier stand by again restricting entry into HP?",
    "\nWe have gone stricter now as many people had started entering with fake information, hiding the original destination and zone they started from. So we have made some documents mandatory for the passes. More so because most people who were really in trouble outside Himachal have already come back.",
    "Q) Where did your strategy fail?",
    "We changed our strategy as per the situation. The strong feedback mechanism helped us. I stayed connected with cross sections, including district authorities and elected representatives at the grassroots through video conferences. Initially, the stress was due to lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), ventilators, testing facility etc. Now we are well-equipped in every sense. The testing capacity has gone fairly high ‚Äì from 130 per day to 1,500.",
    "Q) As a first-time CM, how did you find the going in the Covid time?",
    "\nNobody had the experience to fight Covid-19, whether leadership, administration or health set-up across the world. First-time or experienced, no CM has ever faced such a challenge in life, where a virus threw life and economy out of gear. It was tough, but I kept learning. There may have been shortcomings, but we were able to reduce the impact of Covid to an extent. The Active Case Finding of HP was appreciated by the PM and other states were asked to follow us. Whatever we could do, we did. Even Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Delhi sought information from us. In fact, Himachal is safe and the care here is good, that‚Äôs why many people want to come back here in Covid (time) even today.",
    "Q) What is the way forward?",
    "We all have understood that we have to live with Corona in times to come, so better take precautions. Corona cases are increasing but people are getting used to the situation and life is limping back to normal. We will have to address the issues of economic derailment now, with people going jobless and industry, especially tourism, suffering in the state. We will, however, decide on opening schools, temples and hotels as per Government of India‚Äôs directions."

The 1993 ‚ÄòAgreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas‚Äô provides a framework for peaceful negotiations towards resolution of disputes and for management of contingencies along the Line of Actual Control. The agreement has served its purpose well so far and the leaderships of both countries have demonstrated sagacity and statesmanship to diffuse clashes or standoffs between their armies. The informal summits between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping in April 2018 and in Mamallapuram in October 2019 have also underscored the mutual desire for a negotiated settlement besides highlighting the need for broader convergence.",
    "The ongoing stand-off is a test of the credibility of the bilateral processes put in place to manage such situations. It is important that both sides resort to the provende-escalatory mechanisms and withdraw to their pre-incident positions. At a time when Chinese credibility is under a cloud on the global stage, forcing a border situation with India is unlikely to bolster China‚Äôs image as a virtuous great power that it aspires for and may be counter-productive.",
    "Some sections of Chinese state-controlled media have also alleged that India has fuelled the clashes and standoff to detract attention from its handling of the COVID pandemic. They seem to miss the point that India has done reasonably well in handling the pandemic so far. It has negotiated the first wave, prevented community spread and is now well poised to restart its economy.",
    "A border standoff is an unpleasant and unwelcome distraction from the path of pandemic management and economic reconstruction that India is aspiring for. On the contrary, a border standoff whether in the South China Sea or with India would provide China with the perfect cover to distract its populace from the global outrage at China‚Äôs mishandling of the COVID 19 pandemic and the rising demand for investigations into its collusion with WHO.",
    "India is at an inflection point in economic terms. Its economy has started coming back to life and the recent Government stimulus of about 10% of GDP ‚Äì one of the largest globally in percentage terms ‚Äì is set to introduce foundational reforms and kick-start growth. India is in many ways looking to turn crisis into opportunity and increase its share in global manufacturing and seeks to emulate and learn from the Chinese economic model, firmly believing that growth is a win-win and not a zero-sum game for both the countries. China‚Äôs growth in the last forty years made it the manufacturing hub of the world but did not push the erstwhile manufacturing giants such as South Korea and Japan, lower in economic terms.",
    "China and the erstwhile economic powers fed off each other, leveraging each other‚Äôs strengths and spurring onwards to create economic prosperity for all. Consequently, Japan and ROK are the only two developed nations in Asia with China nearly at par in all terms. India today seeks to emulate the same model and has not wavered from its position articulated in 2010 by the then Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh that ‚Äòthe world has enough space to accommodate the growth ambitions of both the countries‚Äô. Therefore, China need not harbour any insecurities on this count.",
    "China and India have a long and rich history of peaceful co-existence. Till about 1600AD, both countries together accounted for more than half the world‚Äôs GDP. Working together, there is a possibility that past glory may be attained again. In the 20th century, China has grown remarkably as it was able to focus internally following the course charted by Deng Xiaoping, without being distracted by external threats. Similarly, now India seeks to lift its masses out of poverty and pursue an agenda of economic and social development with greater focus and without seeking any change in status quo vis-√†-vis the land border. In this context, it would be a win-win again to settle the boundary issues expeditiously so as to benefit future generations.",
    "It is but natural that there will be disagreements and issues between the two neighbours. At a time when China itself has just emerged from a pandemic, the CCP must renew its focus on economic growth and improving the lives of the Chinese citizens. De-escalating the border situation and managing it through established mechanisms is essential to peace, stability, and economic growth of all.",
    "China‚Äôs management of COVID 19 and its medical exports to many countries including India in this crisis has been greatly appreciated. China should build upon the positives while displaying civilizational wisdom in dealing with its Asian neighbours, particularly India. It will add to the goodwill that it is likely to need when its relationship with WHO towards the management of COVID 19 is called into question and pressure mounts in the South China Sea.",

    "The makers of Amazon Original Series Breathe are all set to bring their second season Breathe: Into The Shadows on July 10th. The much-anticipated series has already managed to garner a lot of public attention ever since its trailer has been released. The intriguing trailer gives us a sneak peek into the journey of Avinash Sabharwal (played by Abhishek Bachchan), as he and his wife (played by Nithya Menen) delve into the case of their kidnapped daughter, Siya. Alongside, senior Inspector Kabir Sawant (played by Amit Sadh) is making a return in the show. However, what‚Äôs adding an extra element to the series is Saiyami Kher, who recently made audiences go woo with her stellar performance in Anurag Kashyap‚Äôs ",
    "Choked",

    "Recently, in an exclusive interview with thestatesman.com, Saiyami opened up about her character and expectations from the show. She also talked about the raging nepotism debate in Bollywood making rounds on social media.",
    "Excerpts",
    "Tell us something about your character in the show ‚ÄòBreathe: Into the shadows‚Äô and what made you opt for it?",
    "There‚Äôs not too much of my character that has come out in the trailer. My character‚Äôs name is Shirley who is an escort. It has been inspired by Julia Roberts‚Äôs character in Pretty Woman. But, I was very excited to be in this character because it‚Äôs something that was never offered to me before and is very different from what I have done in previous releases including Special Ops, Choked and Mirzya.",
    "After Choked getting rave reviews, what are your expectations from Breathe?",
    "I am very elated with what ",
    "Choked",
    " has given me as a character. Considering Breathe, its first season has left me spellbound. I have really enjoyed it, so I am hoping that this season will make it bigger and better. Also, it has been an absolute pleasure to work with Abhishek Bachchan and director Mayank. This time, it‚Äôs a completely different character that I have played in Breathe, with an all glamorous avatar. So, I am just hoping people like my work and I am waiting for their reviews about the same.",
    "How is the second season of Breathe completely different from the first one?",
    "It‚Äôs completely a new story. This season will see Amit Sadh‚Äôs character in a new avatar. In the trailer, we have seen that the lead characters including Abhishek Bachchan and Nithya Menen are trying to save their daughter. So, it‚Äôs a similar storyline with completely different characters and new plot.",
    "Nowadays, everyone is heading towards OTT, which has become a new normal. What‚Äôs your take on films releasing online?",
    "As far as films releasing online because of lockdown, we don‚Äôt have a choice but I feel it‚Äôs a very healthy atmosphere because at least viewers have something to watch. Right now, I am very happy with the amount of stuff coming out on OTT. Having said that, I think, others will always be alive while things resume; there will be big films that will release in theatres. So, I think there will be a melange of both OTT and theatres in future.",
    "While nepotism debate is raging in Bollywood, how do you see it?",
    "I feel like this debate has been going on for many years. Too many people have too many opinions on this subject right now. There are different people who have made a mark; there are people who have not made a mark and have been a part of the industry. But I do agree that these people from the industry get through more opportunities and that is the only thing which triggers. But finally, the audience decided the fate of an actor.",
    "Is there some sort of insecurity with you also?",
    "No, I don‚Äôt have any insecurity because I feel I need to keep working on myself and when the time is right I will get my due.",
    "What are your upcoming projects?",
    "I am all set to make my Tollywood comeback with Ahishor Solomon‚Äôs ",
    "Wild Dog",
    " which also features Nagarjuna. We have 20 days of shoot left. Besides, I have two web series in the pipeline."

    "Seventy-three years after independence, the majestic Rohtang tunnel will unlock the fate of tribal folks in Lahaul valley in the cold desert of Lahaul Spiti district in Himachal Pradesh.",
    "The 8.8 kilometre long tunnel is set to be operational in September this year and will give all weather connectivity to Lahaul that remained cut off from the rest of the world for almost six months through winters every year, following heavy snow on 13050 feet high Rohtang Pass.",
    "The Rohtang Pass connects Manali with Lahaul.¬†The tunnel, costing Rs 3500 crore, was the dream project of former Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and is hence named Atal tunnel.",
    "It will reduce the travelling time from Manali to Lahaul to half and is of strategic importance from defence point of view as Lahaul connects to Leh ahead.",
    "Lahaul Spiti district comprises Lahaul and Spiti valleys, with Kunzum Pass (15060 feet high) in between. Spiti is accessible through tribal district Kinnaur, but is cut off from Lahaul valley in winters due to heavy snow on Kunzum Pass.",
    "It was a challenging job for the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) to dig up an all-weather tunnel in the toughest of terrain. The project that took off on ground ten years back hit many roadblocks because of harsh weather all these years.",
    "‚ÄúWe are waiting in wings. Next winter will be different. This will change the world for us,‚Äù said Mohan Lal, 62, of Malang village in Lahaul.",
    "‚ÄúWe passed the winters from November to May, eating, dancing and enjoying community festivals.¬†¬†But the period was no less than an ordeal every year, as it stalled development, economy and left people on the mercy of God in medical emergencies,‚Äù said Yamuna Devi, 32, from Keylong.",
    "She revealed that pregnant women faced much difficulty in winters in an emergency as there were no specialists in Keylong hospital and subsidised chopper flights to tribal belts were uncertain.",
    "The feeling is echoed by the tribals from different walks of life as they had to spend virtually half of their lives landlocked in Lahaul due to snow every winter, or afford a house in adjacent Kullu to live a comfortable life.",
    "Over the years, there has been a slow exodus from Lahaul with more and more people looking for greener pastures outside the tribal area due to tough conditions back home.",
    "In the 2011 census, Lahaul Spiti district of Himachal had shown a negative decadal growth rate of population (- 5.0 per cent from 2001-2011), with migration from the area cited as one of the main reasons for this.",
    "The locals in Lahaul feel that once the tunnel is operational, it will boost the local development and economy, and may ultimately help in reverse migration.",
    "‚ÄúThis will bring tourism and help in related progress, right from roads to infrastructure. We can promote winter tourism in a big way in Lahaul,‚Äù said Tsering, 39, who runs a food joint in Keylong.",
    "The officials in Lahaul say the all-weather connectivity will help in overall mainstreaming of the area.",
    "‚ÄúPeople had to go out for good education; medical facilities etc. Generally the government employees don‚Äôt want to join in the tribal area because of harsh conditions and lack of basic facilities. The round-the-year connectivity will lead to better education and health care services in Lahaul and improve attendance in the government offices also,‚Äù they said."

Spread the desiccated coconut out onto a pan and toast it till it turns golden brown. Pour condensed milk into a saucepan and add finely chopped white chocolate. Turn the heat on medium and cook the milk until the chocolate melts. Keep stirring to avoid it from burning. It would be a shame to have to restart after coming this far. Once it‚Äôs done, switch off the heat and mix the toasted coconut, salt and almonds with our star ingredient, Dried Cranberries. Give it a stir and then pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan.

    "During the initial days of MS Dhoni‚Äôs international career, when runs were not coming off his bat, people talked more about his long locks than his skills on the pitch. Many cricketing experts and fans alike wondered whether the Ranchi lad is serious about leaving a mark in the sport.",
    "However, gradually Dhoni proved everybody wrong by his skills and performances on the pitch. Dhoni then led India to 2007 T20 World Cup win and won hearts of his fans around the world, many of whom were now seen imitating the ‚ÄòDhoni hairstyle‚Äô.",
    "‚ÄúI have seen a lot of cricketers in my cricket career of more than two decades, some from close quarters and some from a distance. While some had their focus on the game, others were interested in the fame. While some climbed up the stairs of success, others only had their collars up. Some were crazy about cricket while others were struck by fashion. But this guy [MS Dhoni] was unique,‚Äù the cricketer-turned-commentator recalled in the latest video uploaded on his Youtube channel ‚ÄòAakash‚ÄâVani‚Äô.",
    "‚ÄúHe had long golden hair, white sunscreen on the face and branded goggles over his eyes. If you glance at him, you would ask him to move aside as this was a cricket ground and not a Bollywood set. But here only he surprises you, like he did to me, his own roommate,‚Äù the former batsman said.",
    "‚ÄúThe incident is from 2004, India A‚Äôs tour to Zimbabwe and Kenya when me, Aakash Chopra, a Test opener, and my junior MS Dhoni were sharing a room. When I would ask what he would like to eat, he would say whatever I wanted to order. When I would ask when he would sleep, he would say whenever I would switch off the light,‚Äù the former batsman went on.",
    "‚ÄúTo say frankly, I had not expected such cordiality from this long-haired cool dude. I had thought he would say ‚Äì ‚ÄòYou leave it, I will only order‚Äô or ‚ÄòI sleep late, you can put the bedsheet on your face and sleep‚Äô. It is said that greatness starts from simplicity. Simple life, high thinking.",

    "‚ÄúWhen I told him lovingly to cut his hair as people may not consider him seriously, he responded back saying ‚Äì ‚ÄòI am not cutting my hair, probably people might grow their hair after seeing me‚Äô,‚Äù Chopra recalled.",
    "‚ÄúIt is said that Pakistan‚Äôs General Pervez Musharraf had also asked him not to cut his hair. We bow to MS Dhoni, to his talk and his confidence. Nowadays in every nook and corner, we see MS Dhoni‚Äôs haircut,‚Äù the former batsman added.",

    "The team from Rutgers University in the US found that people with asthma ‚Äì even those with diminished lung function who are being treated to manage asthmatic inflammation ‚Äì seem to be no worse affected by SARS-CoV-2 than a non-asthmatic person.",
    "‚ÄúOlder age and conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and obesity are reported risk factors for the development and progression of COVID-19,‚Äù said Reynold A.

    "Children and young adults with asthma suffer mainly from allergic inflammation, while older adults who experience the same type of airway inflammation can also suffer from eosinophilic asthma ‚Äî a more severe form.",
    "In these cases, people experience abnormally high levels of a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection, which can cause inflammation in the airways, sinuses, nasal passages and lower respiratory tract, potentially making them more at risk for a serious case of COVID-19.",
    "In addition, an enzyme attached to the cell membranes in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines that has been shown to be an entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into cells is increased in response to the virus.",
    "‚ÄúThis enzyme is also thought to be beneficial in clearing other respiratory viruses, especially in children. How this enzyme affects the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect people with asthma is still unclear,‚Äù said the study.",
    "However, older people with asthma who also have high blood pressure, diabetes or heart disease may have similar instances of Covid-19 as non-asthmatics with those conditions, the researchers stressed.",
    "Future studies should address whether inhaled steroids in patients with asthma or allergies increase or decrease the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and whether these effects are different depending on the steroid type."

    "‚ÄúWe have already lost the peak season to Coronavirus and there won‚Äôt be much tourists rush and the decision would only jeopardize the safety of our staff and local population as well.",
    "We want the tourists to take sweet memories with them when they return from Himachal but this decision without proper arrangements or training can prove detrimental to the tourism sector in the state,‚Äù he added.",
    "FOHRA president Ramswaroop Sharma even raised questions on the validity of COVID-19 reports and said, ‚ÄúWe have seen in Punjab and UP as to how such test reports can be bought or tampered with. What is the guarantee that tourists who are submitting the report to the state government are genuine,‚Äù he told The Statesman.",
    "TISHA president Mohinder Seth, however, welcomed the decision and thanked¬†Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur as it would provide much-needed relief to the tourism sector which was worst hit in lockdown.",
    "‚ÄúTourist¬†places in other parts of the country as Uttarakhand, Goa, Rajasthan, Kerala have been opened for visitors and it would have badly affected Himachal if the state government hadn‚Äôt opened the border for them,‚Äù he said.",
    "Seth said the hotels would lose winter season too if hotels weren‚Äôt opened in the state now and in addition, the hotels would get prepared as per SOPs for coming tourist seasons as it was already off-season for the tourism sector in Himachal Pradesh."
