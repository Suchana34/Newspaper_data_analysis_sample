    "President Donald Trump on Tuesday formally started the withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization, making good on threats to deprive the UN body of its top funding source over its response to the coronavirus.",
    "Public health advocates and Trump's political opponents voiced outrage at the departure from the Geneva-based body, which leads the global fight on maladies from polio to measles to mental health -- as well as Covid-19, at a time when cases have again been rising around the world.",
    "After threatening to suspend the $400 million in annual US contributions and then announcing a withdrawal, the Trump administration has formally sent a notice to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, a State Department spokesperson said.",
    "The withdrawal is effective in one year -- July 6, 2021 -- and Joe Biden, Trump's presumptive Democratic opponent, is virtually certain to stop it and stay in the WHO if he wins the November election.",
    "A spokesman for Guterres and the global health body itself confirmed that the United States, a key founding WHO member, gave its notice.",
    "In a speech earlier in the day, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said of Covid-19, \"National unity and global solidarity are more important than ever to defeat a common enemy.\"",
    "In line with conditions set when the WHO was set up in 1948, the United States can leave within one year but must meet its remaining assessed financial obligations, the UN spokesman said.",
    "In late May, Trump said that China exerted \"total control\" over the WHO and accused the UN body led by Tedros, an Ethiopian doctor and diplomat, of failing to implement reforms.",
    "Blaming China for the coronavirus, Trump, a frequent critic of the UN, said the United States would redirect funding \"to other worldwide and deserving, urgent, global public health needs.\"",
    "Democratic lawmakers have accused Trump of seeking to deflect criticism from his handling of the pandemic in the United States, which has suffered by far the highest death toll of any nation despite the president's stated hope that the virus will disappear.",
    "\"To call Trump's response to Covid chaotic and incoherent doesn't do it justice,\" said Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.",
    "\"This won't protect American lives or interests -- it leaves Americans sick and America alone,\" he wrote on Twitter.",
    "Representative Ami Bera, himself a physician, said that the United States and World Health Organization had worked \"hand in hand\" to eradicate smallpox and nearly defeat polio.",
    "\"Our cases are increasing,\" Bera said of Covid-19. \"If the WHO is to blame: why has the US been left behind while many countries from South Korea to New Zealand to Vietnam to Germany return to normal?\"",
    "Even some of Trump's Republican allies had voiced hope that he was exerting pressure rather than making a final decision to abandon the World Health Organization.",
    "The investigative news outlet ProPublica reported last month that most of Trump's aides were blindsided by the WHO withdrawal announcement, which he made during an appearance about China.",
    "The Trump administration has said that the WHO ignored early signs of human-to-human transmission in China, including warnings from Taiwan -- which, due to Beijing's pressure, is not part of the UN body.",
    "While many public health advocates share some criticism of the WHO, they question what other options the world body had other than to work with China, where Covid-19 was first detected late last year in the city of Wuhan.",
    "The anti-poverty campaign ONE said the United States should work to reform, not abandon, the WHO.",
    "\"Withdrawing from the World Health Organization amidst an unprecedented global pandemic is an astounding action that puts the safety of all Americans the world at risk,\" it said."

    "India remains cautious as China has not yet shown any signs of thinning out the large number of troops it amassed in the “rear areas” on its side of the disputed boundary, although both sides started pulling back front-line soldiers from some of the face-off scenes in eastern Ladakh.",
    "After the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) pulled back its troops from the scene of the June 15 clash at Galwan Valley, the Indian Army too withdrew troops 1.5 kilometers away from the spot, in keeping with the disengagement understanding reached between the senior military officials of the two nations during the three meetings they had last month to resolve the nine-week-long stand-off.  ",
    "Though the Indian Army soldiers earlier routinely patrolled Galwan Valley, they would not do so for some time. The two sides agreed on a moratorium on patrolling during the last meeting between the senior commanders of the Indian and Chinese armies on June 30.",
    "While New Delhi has been dismissing Beijing’s claim of sovereignty on Galwan Valley over the past few weeks, the withdrawal of Indian Army troops from the area to reciprocate to pullback by the Chinese PLA as well as the moratorium on patrolling triggered speculation about an understanding between the two sides to create a “buffer zone” to avoid flashpoints.",
    "“By agreeing to a ‘buffer zone’ on the Indian side of the LAC and to restrict Indian patrolling to the west of the confluence of the Galwan and Shyok rivers, India will stay out of the Galwan Valley, thus giving credence to China's freshly minted claim to the entire Galwan Valley,” eminent strategic affairs analyst, Brahma Chellaney, posted on Twitter on Tuesday.             ",
    "The Indian Army, however, said that the moratorium on patrolling by both sides in Patrol Point 14 area in the Galwan Valley was not permanent. “This is only a temporary step which would be in place till the disengagement process is complete. No permanent buffer zone has been created,” said an officer of the Indian Army.",
    "The sources in Indian Army said that while the process of troop withdrawal at Patrol Point-14 (PP-14) in the Galwan valley had been completed on Monday, the disengagement process was continuing at PP-15 (Gogra Post) on Tuesday. It would take one more day to complete the process at PP-17A (Hot Springs). The Indian Army is currently monitoring the pull back with drone footage besides keeping an eye on the conflict area from a distance. The confirmatory report will be prepared after senior PLA commanders verify the withdrawal and report it back to the Indian Army in accordance with a mutually accepted protocol, said sources.",
    "New Delhi, however, remains worried about the continuing stand-off on the northern bank of the Pangong Tso lake, where the Chinese PLA deployed soldiers and built structures at the “Finger 4” area, thus denying access to Indian Army to areas up to its earlier patrolling limit – the “Finger 8”. Sources said that although the PLA had apparently thinned out some of its troops and vehicles from “Finger 4”, the numbers were not significant.        ",
    "China also remained non-committal on withdrawing the large number of troops it deployed over the past few weeks in the rear areas on its side of its disputed boundary with India – flouting the 1993 bilateral agreement, which required each side to “keep its military forces in the areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to a minimum level”."

  "content": [
    "A staggering 1.2 million Indians died from snakebites in the last 20-years since 2000, says a new study, pegging India’s annual average snakebite deaths at nearly 58,000.",
    "Around 70% of such deaths occurred in limited low altitude, rural areas of eight states - Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana), Rajasthan and Gujarat. Half of all deaths took place in the monsoon period.",
    "This is a sharp increase from the previous figure of 46,000 annual snakebite deaths, as shown by the same group of researchers in 2011. Half the world’s snakebite deaths happen in India.",
    "Available data indicated that most envenomations were due to Russell’s vipers, followed by kraits and cobras.",
    "“Our study directly quantified and identified the populations most affected by fatal snakebites in India. We showed that the overall lifetime risk of being killed by snakebite is about 1 in 250, but in some areas, the lifetime risk reaches 1 in 100,\" said Prabhat Jha, senior author of the study and director of Centre for Global Health Research at the University of Toronto.",
    "Snakebite, which primarily targets rural farmers and their families, was the most neglected of all tropical diseases. But since 2017, it has been prioritised by the World Health Organization.",
    "In 2019, WHO launched its strategy for prevention and control of snakebite, aiming to halve the numbers of deaths and serious disabilities by 2030.",
    "Nine years ago, as an extension of his Million Death Study, Jha and his colleagues had analysed the snakebite deaths in India in what was known as the largest ever nationally representative mortality survey to include snakebites. The study contributed towards WHO’s revised annual estimate of snakebite deaths.",
    "In the new study published in the journal eLife on Tuesday, the CGHR researchers expanded the scope of the previous study by adding 11 more years of field data from covering 600,000 randomly selected deaths, and a systematic review of 78 Indian snakebite studies.",
    "“Snakes are a vital part of our ecosystem as rodent controllers and are important in religion and mythology,” says Romulus Whitaker, at the Centre for Herpetology at the Madras Crocodile Bank. “Since deaths are restricted mainly to lower altitude, intensely agricultural areas, during a single season of each year, this should make the annual epidemics easier to manage. India’s tremendous snakebite burden is staring us in the face and we need to act now!”"

    "Asserting that mental health services including advocacy and awareness campaigns should essentially become part of the government's response to Covid-19, Union Health Secretary Preeti Sudan also stressed on the need to bring mental health issues to foreground and make them accepted as common ailments.",
    "In a letter addressed to Chief Secretaries and the administrators of all states and UTs, Sudan said that psychosocial concerns cut across age groups and segments of the population and that it is imperative that all the care providers including volunteers, police and all frontline workers are aware and equipped with the appropriate training.",
    "The country is grappling with the challenge of Covid-l9 and concerns relating to mental health, manifested in feelings of fear, anxiety, negative thoughts about consequences of disease and subsequent depression are being raised, Sudan said in the letter, dated July 6.",
    "\"Incidence and prevalence of mental health issues, however, tend to be higher in the urban areas, and even more skewed towards the metropolitan cities. While there may be many causative factors to this reality, declining social support in the nuclear families and restricted social networking due to Covid-19 are among important reasons.",
    "\"The identification and acceptance of mental health issues is relatively low due to the stigma attached with it,\" she said in the letter.",
    "Given the above factors, it is imperative to focus on preventive aspects of mental healthcare and early detection, Sudan underlined.",
    "The common signs and symptoms of the depression and anxiety need to be discussed openly so that anybody who starts facing the problem is able to identify, accept and seek help. Lack of knowledge and ignorance is what aggravates the problem, she said.",
    "\"Keeping above in view, I request you to put in place and strengthen mechanisms for amplifying awareness about mental health through existing communication materials... initiate screening and address mental health issues for those in need, improve help seeking behaviour on mental health related issues by sensitising people and health care workers,\" she said.",
    "Sudan shared some of the steps taken by the Ministry to address them which include setting up of helpline (080-4611 0007), in collaboration with National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS) to provide psychosocial support by mental health professionals.",
    "It also includes onboarding of 20 states on the national psychosocial support helpline, the letter said, stating that remaining States/UTs are also encouraged to join the helpline in order to expand its reach.",
    "The measures initiated by the ministry also includes issuance of guidelines/ advisories on management of mental health issues, catering to different segments of the society.",
    "National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS) has also been working towards building capacity of health workers in providing support and has undertaken online training of psychologists across the country for providing brief and basic telephonic psychological support in the context of Covid-l9, the letter said.",

    "The onset of monsoon is no doubt a time of relief from the scorching summer heat as temperatures drop and the landscape turns lush green and vibrant. However, the monsoon",
    "months infamously bring with them a number of infections such as influenza and water-borne diseases which are more likely to have an adverse effect on those who have a weak immune system. This is particularly a problem for patients who are immunosuppressed due to previous medical conditions such as kidney problems and those on dialysis. They are referred to as an immunocompromised group of patients due to their reduced ability to fight infections and other diseases, causing them to be at a higher risk of catching an infection.",
    "Kidneys are vital organs of our body as they filter out the waste products and excess fluid harmful to the body through urine. They are also responsible for the production of red blood cells and critical regulation of the body’s salt potassium and acid content. A renal or kidney failure prevents the kidneys from performing their function to regulate fluids and balance electrolytes.",
    "The rainy season is an invitation to infections and is a time for micro-organisms to breed and destroy our cells. It is extremely important to take precautionary measures to keep infections and diseases at bay especially for kidney patients. Here are a few tips to avoid monsoon infections and maintain overall health:",
    "Water-borne infections are the most common and the supply of safe drinking water is gravely hampered. It is therefore recommended to drink boiled or filtered water throughout these months keeping in mind the fluid intake recommended by your nephrologist.",
    "Keep your surroundings clean. Maintain a hygienic environment around you by cleaning or disinfecting regularly touched surfaces. This helps keep micro-organisms transferable through touch, at bay. Due to the humidity in the air, which is a source of moisture for mould development, at-home dialysis machines should be maintained, sanitised and wiped clean at least twice a week.",
    "With the ongoing uncertainty on eating food from outside, it is best to continue eating home-cooked food. With the dangers of a global pandemic, kidney patients must be extra cautious of their food intake and consume more immunity-rich foods regularly.",
    "Similarly, consume fruits that are freshly cut or wholesome. Pre-cut fruits accumulate micro-organisms that are harmful to the body when ingested. Wash the fruit thoroughly before eating and peel the outer skin before consuming as they may be laced with pesticides or other germs.",
    "Monsoons often induce cravings of eating fried foods or processed and packaged food. However, these foods are high in sodium, potassium and sugars that pose a risk to your health. Processed food adversely affects the kidneys while high glucose levels lead to diabetes and complications and must, therefore, be avoided.",
    "Kidney patients must live in airy spaces with enough ventilation and openings for sunlight. If you are required to step out, use face masks. If you do get wet while outdoors, return home and have a hot water bath and pat yourself dry. Always keep a napkin and sanitiser handy.",

    "As much as monsoon makes our environment green and scenic, the moisture levels rise and so does the humidity. With all the moisture present in the surroundings, it paves the way for fungal infections, especially of the feet since they are always drenched in water or tightly enclosed in footwear. Taking a little extra care of your feet in the rainy season can prevent painful and serious foot conditions. Here are a few tips on how you can prevent fungal infections:",
    "Firstly, if one is already suffering from fungal infection, do not self-medicate. Avoid using over-the-counter steroid creams because they do nothing more than flaring up the infection and making the fungal strains resistant to approved antifungal medications. Consult a dermatologist.",
    "One needs to take appropriate dermatologist-approved antifungal medications, antihistamines and topical treatments for a good 4-6 weeks.",
    "Always wear open rubber/ plastic footwear. Wearing closed fabric footwear soaks up moisture, increasing the chances of fungal infections.",
    "Pat the skin dry before layering clothes, also use an antifungal dusting powder or talc on body folds like armpits, groin, finger and toe spaces and the waistline.",
    "Avoid using a moisturiser during the day since it would overhydrate the skin and damage the skin barrier, giving an easy entry for not only fungi but also other microbes.",
    "It is essential to wash clothes in hot water or iron them as it kills the fungi attached to the cloth lining.",
    "For diabetic patients, keeping the glucose levels within normal limits plays a crucial role in managing fungal infections as glucose provides a good medium for fungi to grow.",

    "wanderlust:",
    "Old vintage suitcases",
    "Since you can’t pack your suitcases and take off on an adventure in Covid-19 times, don’t let anyone stop you from unleashing your imagination and having fun recycling old suitcases. Dig out grandma’s vintage trunks or some of your antique travel suitcases. Stack them on top of each other and use them as a display table, or keep them open and showcase your travel maps, souvenirs etc., or you could even repurpose them as funky wall shelves. Not only will they ease those travel bug symptoms, but they will also personalise your home with your travel stories.",
    "Hypnotic vintage maps",
    "A map is a traveller’s best friend. Gather some maps — muted maritime maps, global maps, travel maps, road maps or children’s school maps. Roll them up and place them on a rug, or simply half-tuck them in an open vintage suitcase. You can even frame them for some serious statement art or decoupage them on some furniture pieces  — bed headboard, decorative drawer fronts, windowpanes or coasters. If you want some history rolled into one, get a replica of the Imago Mundi, a 6th century BCE Babylonian map, considered to be the oldest map of the planet. But, if its real beauty that you desire, get the Mappe Monde Map by Jean Baptiste Nolin, one of the most beautiful maps in the world.",
    "Spin-it-around globes",
    "Yes, globes have spun back into vogue and can truly be a show-stopper in your décor theme. From four inches to 20 inches, there are classic blue ocean educational globes to wooden globes, black globes, gold or brass globes, chalkboard globes and even glass-blown globes by Columbus. You even get some beautiful illuminated light-up globes. You can use these orbs in many ways. Cluster them together, and perch them on a mantel or table or hang them as ceiling lights. Take one giant globe and make it a statement piece, or simply place an antique piece and let heads turn. The best part is you can spend hours spinning them around and exploring your next travel destination.",
    "Travel-inspired poster art",
    "Travel posters add charm and elegance to any travel décor. They come in all styles — quotes, paintings, vintage, pop-art, line drawings, colourful graphics, maps, etc. and can be found on Etsy, Amazon, Shutterstock and various online art galleries. You can nail them up on the walls, or simply tilt and place them alongside your travel décor. They get you in the mood to travel and give a lovely accent to your space. ",
    "Interactive globetrotting trackers",
    "Whether you are a seasoned or novice traveller, you know that every destination you visit is like a conquest that you’re proud of. So, instead of keeping those conquests hidden in your passports, get yourself some interactive travel trackers to display at home.",
    "You can get scratch-off world maps, magnetic wall maps, world wall decals, even scratch-off globes and cork globes that help you mark the places you’ve travelled to.  You might not be Marco Polo or Christopher Columbus, but you’ll surely feel like one.",
    "Travel coffee table books",
    "These beautiful coffee table books, with their glossy pages and large enthralling pictures, not only make your space look luxurious, they let you travel to faraway places without leaving your seat. ",
    "Destinations of a Lifetime",
    " by National Geographic, ",
    "Ultimate Travelist",
    " by Lonely Planet, ",
    "The Bucket List",
    "; ",
    "Wanderlust,",
    " etc., are few of the many books that take you on a spellbinding, photographic tour of the world, while you snuggle in your couch and sip some hot cocoa. ",
    "Eclectic paraphernalia",
    "No travel décor is complete without travel accessories. Forgotten vintage cameras, model aeroplanes, antique brass compasses, engraved leather cases, time-worn clocks, dated binoculars, telescopes, hot air balloon and heritage ship scale models transport you to dream destinations far, far away.",
    "Throwback precious photographs",
    "When you can’t create new memories, dig out the old ones. Those treasured moments that sit, forgotten in your camera, hard drive or cloud, need to be displayed. Create a photo wall with framed pictures of places you have visited. Make a photo collage of all your epic adventures, or hang them on a clothespin board. You can take it up a notch and create your very own travel coffee table book to tell your unique story.",
    "Stowed away memorabilia",
    "There ’s no better way to relive your travels, than taking out your dusty souvenirs and turning them into art. Shadow boxes, wall-mounted cubbies, scrapbooks, memory jars, labelled keepsake boxes, are all creative ways to not only take you down memory lane but also make your collectables, décor head-turners.  ",

  ],
  "date_published": [
    " Jun 25 2020, 01:20 ist"
  ],
  "content": [
    "As the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread globally at the start of this year, the worldwide consensus was that a period of lockdown would break the chain of infections. India acted remarkably quickly in comparison to others. The nationwide lockdown here fell into place on March 25, when the country had a paltry 519 cases and only 10 deaths. In contrast, the UK, when it introduced its lockdown on March 24, had already registered 8,077 cases and 422 deaths. Italy ordered a nationwide lockdown on March 11 when it had already registered 631 deaths and 10,149 cases. ",
    "Follow live updates on the coronavirus here",
    "But now, nearly 13 weeks later, as India prepares to withdraw the last of its lockdown restrictions, the country’s rate of infection is higher than ever, even as the numbers in the UK and Italy have largely flatlined. So where did India's attempt to flatten the curve go so wrong? ",
    " ",
    " ",
    "What did Europe do differently that its lockdown flattened the curve? ",
    "Simply put, it was stringent social distancing, plus the scrupulous wearing of masks and social welfare measures, that saw Europe through. In Italy and Spain, the data shows, the lockdown had a rapid impact. In both countries, the new cases peaked between 13 and 20 days and thereafter began to decline. ",
    "What was the problem with India's lockdown?",
    " ",
    "The problem is not that India introduced a lockdown early, but that the government failed to implement a series of concurrent measures to ensure that the infections did not resurface. ",
    "The fundamental usefulness of the lockdown is to reduce the number of infections for a short period. The government's failure to exploit the lockdown for its true worth is why we are seeing so many cases now, epidemiologists say. ",
    "Dr Giridhar Babu, a pandemic expert, says a lockdown alone cannot stop a pandemic. In the absence of large-scale testing to rapidly identify infected individuals and social welfare programmes, a lockdown cannot succeed on its own, he explains. ",
    "From March 25 to April 23, during the most stringent phases of the lockdown, India's testing reached a peak of only 0.36 tests per 1,000 people — not enough to gauge the spread of the disease within the population. ",
    "The central government now says nearly one lakh tests are being done daily. While these might seem an impressive number, it still translates to roughly only 5.3 tests per 1,000 people, as per data from the Karnataka state Covid war room. In comparison, the UK is currently out 60.4 tests per 1,000 of the population. In Karnataka, the rate is 7.9 tests per 1,000. ",
    " ",
    " ",
    "So did India bungle social distancing?",
    "A lockdown, intended to freeze people in place, is a good thing while tackling a pandemic, but its value is contingent on how well social distancing is carried out. In the Indian context, dense population clusters and large numbers of people living in the same household made social distancing a tricky proposition, says Dr Vivekanada Jha, Director of the George Institute for Global Health (India).",
    "In the end, the lockdown had the exact opposite effect that it was intended for. \"While the lockdown bought us enough time to expand our medical infrastructure, it arguably also expanded the spread of the disease,\" Dr Jha said. \"What the lockdown did was relegate people in densely congested areas where if one person has the disease, then others contract it as well. The result is a larger spread.\" ",
    "A glimpse of this spread dynamic was captured in Bengaluru’s densely populated Shivajinagar where a single hotel worker with the disease infected 46 others in his residential building through the use of a single common toilet. ",
    "The government’s failure to enact a financial safety net for ordinary citizens is also said to have inherently doomed the lockdown to failure.",
    "The end result could be less social distancing, post-lockdown, cautioned Suvrat Raju, a theoretical physicist at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences. \"The economic compulsions of people and the fact that marketplaces, malls and businesses will be anxious to rebound from the financial crunch could eventually dilute social distancing norms,\" he said. ",
    "He added that without these concurrent measures, simple mathematical models suggest that \"there is a risk that when the pandemic has run its course, it will have extracted almost the same final toll in lives as it would have without the lockdown.\" ",
    "Was the introduction of the lockdown too hasty? ",
    "Potentially so, experts say, pointing to the fact that zero notice of the lockdown meant, for example, that millions of migrant workers employed in daily-wage jobs in cities were not able to return to their home states in time. ",
    "Although subsequent plans were made to feed stranded daily-wage workers, they were largely a failure, prompting NGOs and private donors to step in. The government’s neglect of migrant workers rebounded when interstate and inter-district travel restrictions were withdrawn in May. Scores of hitherto undetected but infected people crossing state borders have triggered a spike in cases. ",
    "This is perhaps the ultimate legacy of India's lockdown: Starting early, but without the heft to ensure that the people's needs were taken care of and then running out of steam before it could have any long-term impact against the pandemic. "

Patients are coming in very sick condition. We do not have manpower to upgrade bed capacity. For 10 patients, we need at least one nurse for six hours.\"",
    "Another doctor, requesting anonymity, said that a helpline to shift patients is the need of the hour. \"We don't know where to refer them. The BBMP has given us a list of hospitals but when we call them, they say beds are full.\"   ",
    "Covid-19 suspects are as much the government's responsibility as positive cases. However, Tushar Girinath, head of the task force to streamline bed availability and allotment in Bengaluru, minced no words.

    "Known for his performances in films like \"Yuva\", \"Guru\", \"Bunty Aur Babli\" and \"Bluffmaster\", the 44-year-old actor said in the spirit of going ahead the first thing he has to offer is his work.",

    "\"There are lesser and lesser fantastical characters. Our most popular heroes today are all great characters which have one or two flaws which just makes them real. That just makes the character more tactile and approachable,\" he added.",
    "Besides \"Into The Shadows\", the actor has a slate of three films -- \"The Big Bull\", reportedly based on India's biggest securities scam of 1992, Anurag Basu's anthology \"Ludo\" and crime thriller \"Bob Biswas\".",
    "A rags-to-riches story \"The Big Bull\", which will digitally release on Disney+Hotstar, has \"thematic similarities\" to \"Guru\". The 2007 drama directed by Mani Ratnam also charted the journey of a simple man's rise to ambition.",

    "\"'The Big Bull' is a story of perseverance, hard work, and dedication. I like watching inspirational movies. What I liked about this one is that it wasn't just a whitewash piece,\" he added.",
    "The actor, who has also worked with Ratnam in \"Yuva\" (2004) and \"Raavan\" (2010), said he would love to collaborate with the \"genius\" filmmaker again.",
    "\"He is one of my favourite directors. Mani has an amazing way of working. He tells great stories, his style of telling those stories is unique. I'm blessed to have three Mani Ratnam films in my repertoire. I know actors who would give an arm and a leg to do one film with him.",
    "\"Mani is family to me and Aishwarya. He just has to call me and I'll be there.\"",
    "\"Ludo\", a dark anthology comedy, gave him an opportunity to work with Basu, the director with a \"wonderful, quirky mind\".",
    "\"He is a director I've had great admiration for. A latent desire that I'd get the opportunity to work with him and he's lived up to it. He's a mad genius. I loved working with him. I just love the way he looks at life and I think that reflects in his films. He has a very unique perspective on everyday things,\" Abhishek said.",
    "Production on \"Bob Biswas\" came to a halt amid the coronavirus-led lockdown and they still have about 12-13 days of shoot left.",
    "The actor said they want to finish the shooting on a priority basis.",
    "Bob Biswas was a breakout character in filmmaker Sujoy Ghosh's 2012 thriller \"Kahaani\", starring Vidya Balan. Played by actor Saswata Chatterjee, Bob was an LIC agent who moonlighted as a cold-blooded contract killer. "

    "The Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry has proposed bringing under its purview the content being streamed on the several over-the-top (OTT) platforms, said a top ministry official said on Tuesday.",
    "At present, OTT platforms that are digitally streamed falls under the domain of the Ministry of Information and Technology (IT).  ",
    "\"OTT being a digital platform will fall under the purview of the Ministry of IT but now we are proposing a decision that the content should fall within the purview of I&B ministry,” said Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Secretary Amit Khare.",
    "He said \"there is a need for convergence of various ministries (in this regard), particularly in the ways changes are happening, (it) is extremely necessary\".",
    "Khare rued that regulatory regimes in India have been developed as per the platforms and the country has no regulations as of now for the emerging media like OTT players.",
    "Out of \"five different media -- print, radio, TV, films and OTT -- four of them have certain kinds of regulatory practices and one is unregulated\", he said adding that currently a film released on OTT is not covered under the Central Board of Film Certification as it not exhibited as a film there.   ",
    "Recently during the lockdown, several OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, ATLBalaji have witnessed a huge jump in their subscription.",
    "As movie halls are also closed due to lockdown, several production houses have released their movie directly on OTT, bypassing theatrical releases.",
    "While talking about the convergence, he said telecom and media & entertainment should be on equal footing in terms of adjusted gross revenue (AGR).",
    "\"What happens to AGR in telecom has to be applicable in the M&E sector. We cannot have two different rates of AGR for the telecom sector and M&E sector for DTH providers. So there is a need for convergence,” the secretary said.  ",
    "He also stressed on the need to have a level-playing field, but quickly added that this does not mean that all would be brought under a “very heavy regulatory structure”.",
    "The focus of the government in the last few years has been on \"less regulation but more effective regulation\".",

However, if you’re worried about the new price and are considering how to continue making your tasty dishes that does not include tomatoes, here are a few ways you can do that. ",

    "The tangy tomato, cashew and butter are what makes this dish special. But here’s a way you can make it without the red fruit. Start by adding butter, ginger, garlic, cashews and onions in a pan and saute it on medium-high heat. Once it turns slightly brown, keep it aside to cool and then grind the mixture. Transfer the paste to a pan and add some water. Then add your dry spices, including salt. Add cream, garam masala, kasthoori methi and mix well.

  ],

  "content": [
    "Spring onion is a common ingredient in many dishes, especially Chinese. It gives a nice aroma, flavour and crunch when added as a garnish. ",
    "While fully grown onions have a very strong taste and smell, the subtle flavour of spring onions can improve the taste of a dish. ",
    "What we commonly know as spring onion is the onion plant before the bulb is fully grown.",
    "When the bulb (usually not wider than the green part) is the smallest, it is called scallion. When it becomes slightly bigger, it is called green onion and when the bulb takes a round shape, it is called spring onion. There are more variations in the plant depending on the region around the world.",
    "The Allium vegetable family consists of, apart from scallions, onions, garlic, leeks, chives, shallots, Chinese onion and others.",
    "As spring onions and other vegetables in the Allium vegetable family are packed with nutrients like vitamins, fibres, sugars, minerals, proteins and amino acids, it would be a great idea to include them in your diet.",
    "Here are some health benefits of Allium vegetables:",
    "The National Center for Biotechnology Information (USA) has published a research paper which says that consumption of spring onions can decrease risk of cancer.",
    "“The Allium genus includes garlic, onions, shallots, leeks and chives. These vegetables are popular in cuisines worldwide and are valued for their potential medicinal properties. Epidemiological studies, while limited in their abilities to assess Allium consumption, indicate some associations of Allium vegetable consumption with decreased risk of cancer, particularly cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. The majority of supportive evidence on Allium vegetables cancer-preventive effects comes from mechanistic studies,” the research paper says.",
    "Can lower blood sugar",
    "“Allium cepa, a spice plant, is commonly known as onion and belongs to the family Liliaceae. Since ancient times, it has been used traditionally for the treatment of different diseases. Among various activities of Allium cepa, regulation of hypoglycemic activity is considered one of its important effects in DM,” says another research paper published in the NCBI.",
    "Rich in antioxidants",
    "“Allium sativum (garlic) is rich in antioxidants, which help destroy free radical particles that can damage cell membranes and DNA, and may contribute to the aging process as well as the development of a number of conditions, including heart disease and cancer. Antioxidants neutralise free radicals and may reduce or even help prevent some of the damage they cause over time,” says a third paper published in the NCBI.",
    "Antimicrobial properties, heart health",
    "“The bulb and cloves of the garlic are the most commonly used parts of the plants for medicinal purposes. It has a typical pungent odour and antibacterial activity depends on the sulfur-containing compounds, the major one being allicin, which is produced by enzymatic (alliin lyase) hydrolysis of allicin after cutting and crushing of the cloves,” said a paper published in the NCBI based on research at the SSG Hospital, Vadodara.",
    "“Recent researches have focused on four main areas: Heart disease, cancer, infectious disease and antioxidant effects. Garlic is found to have antihypertensive, antioxidant, antiplatelet, antitumor and lipid-lowering actions. Moreover, a recent study also points out towards the antimicrobial action of garlic,” it adds.",
    "How to consume",
    "spring onion",
    "Finely chopped spring onion sprinkled on top will enhance the taste of any Chinese dish, notably stir fry, fried rice or noodles. The bulb (white, bottom portion) of the scallion, spring onion or green onion can be one of the ingredients for a stir fry along with broccoli, carrot, cabbage and capsicum.",

    "Bengaluru has a number of bakers who aren’t professionally qualified. But they know their ingredients and how to market themselves. Resulting in loyal customers across the city who frequently order from them. ",
    "Metrolife",
    " got in touch with some home bakers to share their baking journey, along with some interesting tips for those who want to venture into this field. ",
    "Vegan baked goods",
    "Chaitali Raizada, the owner of Taantraa Organic Handbaking, excels in vegan baking.",
    "She bakes delicious eggless and gluten-free cakes, she’s also accommodating of her customers’ preferences and allergies.",
    "“When my daughter was born, she didn’t take too kindly to all-purpose flour. So I used to substitute that with the likes of almond flour and jaggery. I soon started to market it and sell it to others. It makes me happy knowing that there are other people out there who want to enjoy vegan products.” ",
    "She learnt a few tips and tricks over the years. “I never got professional training, and I believe that’s what makes me my baking bold. I enjoy substituting and experimenting. I’ve learnt that you can always substitute baking ingredients. For example, instead of eggs as a binding ingredient, you can use applesauce or bananas. Likewise, instead of refined sugar, you can use jaggery or raisins.”",
    "Indian ingredients can also be used when baking a cake. That’s how Chaitali made moong daal cake.",
    "“You can also use cashews and raisins to make the icing by soaking it in water and blending them until it forms a smooth consistency,” she explains.",
    "Small ingredients, big flavour",
    "“An unusual ingredient in cakes that I like using is orange zest. This ingredient is essential for my secret family recipe, without which the taste of the cake would be incomplete,” says Divya Haldipur, founder of Itsy Bitsy Bites, who often makes fondant art and cakes.",
    "She believes every day is a learning experience for bakers. The temperature of the ingredients plays a big role in the development of the cake. After all, baking is not just a mere mixing of ingredients but a science, she says.",
    "Be your own boss",
    "Though Sumaiya Ahmed, owner of Sweetfix, started her business recently, she has already become quite popular. ",
    "“I use quality ingredients — from chocolate and cocoa powder to baking powder — I don’t compromise on the quality.”",
    "She likes that she can be her own boss by choosing to be a home baker. “I can work from home, rest when I need to and start baking at any time. I get to spend time with my friends and family, do what I love and also make a living,”  she says.",
    "Always room for more",
    "The Gluten-Free Bread Boutique is the brainchild of Shwetha Muthana. She started off as a home baker selling gluten-free and organically made bread and is now the proud owner of a bakery, a farm where she grows many of her own ingredients, and a baking teacher.",
    "Shwetha also works with doctors, mostly gastroenterologists, to provide her customers with baked goods that suit their allergies and preferences.",
    "“My advice to home bakers is that if they are passionate about baking, then go for it. There is indeed a huge competition in the baking field but it is important to remember each home baker brings their own uniqueness to their products. People who prefer normal cupcakes and cakes may not have the taste for my products, and similarly, my regular customers may not really enjoy regular buttercream cupcakes and cakes. The city is filled with foodies with different tastes, and there is a place for many more bakers,” she concludes."

  "content": [
    "The death of shopkeepers Jayaraj and Bennix at the hands of the police in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, has provoked nationwide outrage.",
    "The incident again underlines the need for police reforms, experts and activists in Bengaluru told Metrolife.",
    "Advocate S Balan says police brutality is colonial legacy, and continues to this day as the country still follows The Police Act of 1861, which allows for violence and torture.",
    "The British ill-treated their citizens, and that hasn’t changed, says BT Venkatesh, advocate and former state public prosecutor.",
    "Mallige Sirimane, activist, says a majority of police brutality cases are not reported in mainstream media, and go unnoticed.",
    "Abuse of power",
    "Mallige recounts the incident of a young man beaten up by the police when he stepped out during the lockdown to buy groceries.",
    "“His arm was broken. Not only did they not own up to the mistake, they even tried to hush up  the case. His brother, an activist, filed a case,” she says.",
    "The story is different for those who are unaware of the law. The violence can manifest in other ways as well. “A few years ago, in Hassan, a young boy was detained for illegally transporting cattle,” she says. “And he was beaten to death while in police custody.”",
    "The police did not lay a finger on him, but were complicit in the violence that claimed his life.",
    "The police have a long way to go when it comes to modern methods of investigation. They still follow primitive methods, and inflict custodial violence on those they suspect. “A girl was burnt to death, and the man who informed the police about it was arrested by the police. They fabricated a story and the evidence. The young man spent eight months in jail,” Mallige says. He was released when the post-mortem report went against the police version.",
    "Modes of torture",
    "Waterboarding, passing electric shocks, inserting chilli in private parts, hanging suspects upside down, beating and lashing them commonly used methods of torture. The methods are chosen carefully to inflict pain, both mental and physical, without causing bleeding, says Venkatesh.",
    "Usually, these tactics are used on first-time offenders on the assumption that it will act as a deterrent. “A year ago, a young boy was caught with a small amount of marijuana. The police gave him electric shocks. When he complained, he was shifted to jail where he was starved for two days. He says he can still feel the shock going through his feet,” says R Kaleemullah, a Swaraj Abhiyan activist.",
    "Any officer who uses inhuman and violent methods must be dismissed immediately, he says.",
    "“A circle inspector in Marathahalli, for example, was suspended after a court order. He was reinstated because of his political connections,” Kaleemulla says.",
    "What’s the solution?",
    "Even though India signed the Convention against Torture in 1997, the government has not ratified it or passed a resolution to this effect. During the UPA regime, the Prevention of Torture Bill, 2010 was introduced in the Lok Sabha. Policemen should learn they are not above the law. “Privileging one group over another leads to the Constitution being taken for granted,” says Mallige.",
    "The normalisation of the growing hegemony of the Hindu right has also legitimised police brutality, especially against Muslims, daily wage earners, women and transgender people.",
    "The nexus between Hindu vigilante and the BJP government has brought structural decay in the police force, says Shivasundar, columnist and activist.",
    "Kaleemullah says the police are in a nexus with politicians and function as their puppets. ",
    "“Making the force independent, like the judiciary, is important,” he urges. Venkatesh calls for a better division of police functions. “The same officer can’t provide security for a politician and also investigate cases against him,” he says. Paucity of funds has paved the way for corporate hiring and funding of police and police stations.",
    "“In Bengaluru, many police stations are funded by corporates. This has led to privatisation of policing when it comes to labour relations and encroachments,” says Shivasundar.",
    "Societal problem",
    "While in the West, many instances of police brutality are linked to racism, here, casteism and classism come into play. ",
    "“It is the Dalits, Adivasis, workers and the minorities who bear the brunt of such behaviour. You will never hear cases of someone privileged undergoing such brutality,” says Balan.",
    "Supporting ‘encounter’ deaths only adds to the problem.",
    "“Everyone celebrated when the accused in the Priyanka Reddy rape case were killed. It was a cold-blooded murder. You can’t praise one instance and cry foul at another,” says Venkatesh.",
    "Glorification of extra-judicial police action in mainstream cinema only adds to the problem, activists say. ",
    "Fallacies in legal recourse",
    "There is no specific law against police brutality which is a large reason for the low rate of reporting and convictions. An aggrieved party can approach the High Courts and Supreme Court for violations of fundamental rights. However, they usually deal only with egregious cases where the burden of proof is high.",
    "The next option is the National and the State Human Rights Commissions, but their recommendations are not binding.  While criminal complaints can be filed against policemen, India has no mechanism for independent investigation. As a result, police personnel often refuse to register FIRs or even statements against their colleagues.  Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code requires prior sanction from the government for the prosecution of a public servant. This is  often misused by the police. Disciplinary proceedings and punishment such as suspension, dismissal and deduction of salary is provided for, but such decisions are not made by an independent body.",
    "Zero conviction",
    "Out of the 5,479 cases against the police that registered in India in 2018, only 41 cases have resulted in convictions. Of 92 registered cases in Karnataka, only 20 cases led to final reports being submitted. The number of convictions is zero. ",
    "(Data from the National Crime Records Bureau)",
    "Mental health important",
    "Activist R Kaleemullah attributes the violence partly to the mental strain cops face. “They have traumatic jobs with long hours, and their mental health is usually in a shambles. It’s important for all policemen to undergo psychological evaluation and counselling at least every six months,” he says. "

    "The first thing Simon Farrell can remember, after being woken from a medically induced coma, is trying to tear off his oxygen mask.",
    "He had been in intensive care for 10 days, reliant on a ventilator just to breathe.",
    "“I was trying to pull the mask off my face, and the nurse kept putting it back on,” he recalls.",
    "When doctors woke him up, his body had fought off the worst of Covid-19 but he still needed oxygen to support his damaged lungs. And the 46-year-old father-of-two was suffering from such severe delirium he was trying to deny himself the oxygen he required.",
    "“Try to stop me,” he remembers saying, when nurses at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital said they would have to put his hands in boxing glove-sized medical mittens unless he relaxed.",
    "“In the end they had to tape my hands up. I was trying to tear the mittens off, I managed to bite through them, and they had to put new mittens on.”",
    "It is not an unfamiliar story for anyone working in intensive care. The assault Covid-19 mounts on the most severely ill means patients are ventilated for longer, and require a deeper level of sedation, than the typical ICU patient.",
    "That has produced “a lot of delirium, confusion and agitation”, explains Dr Kulwant Dhadwal, a consultant who runs the intensive care unit at London’s Royal Free Hospital.",
    "“Usually if you have a surgical procedure, or normal pneumonia patients come to ICU, you wake them up and they’re less confused and less disoriented than this.”",
    "“This particular group of patients were a lot more difficult to wean off the ventilator.”",
    "Even when that process is a success, it is only the beginning of a long process of physical and psychological recovery. And now the UK has moved past the peak of the virus, attention is turning to the huge challenge - both in the health service and in the community - of rehabilitating Covid-19 survivors.",
    "“Often rehabilitation is seen as a Cinderella service and not a priority,” says Sally Singh, professor of pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation at the University of Leicester.",
    "“But because of Covid, and the number of people that it has affected, the need is pressing. It has become a national priority - to support people to get better.”",
    "A LONG ROAD",
    "Tens of thousands of people around the UK are now setting out on that journey.",
    "Some came close to death in intensive care units, others needed less intrusive hospital treatment to help them through the worst. All of them have had their lives changed by Covid-19.",
    "But for the most seriously ill patients in intensive care, rehabilitation begins well before they are woken from a coma. Physical and psychological support has to be there from the start. Even when a patient is asleep, nurses and therapists will move their joints and their bodies to make sure they don’t get too stiff.",
    "“For example, we have an in-bed bike,” explains Kate Tantam, a specialist rehabilitation sister in intensive care at University Hospital Plymouth NHS Trust.",
    "“Even if a patient is on multiple organ support on a ventilator, and on lots of drugs to keep them alive, we will still put them on a bike.”",
    "“We bring it to the bed, and we can put their feet into it, and the machine can then do the work for you.”",
    "ICU staff will also talk constantly to patients while they are deeply sedated, telling them where they are, and what is happening to them, and reassuring them that they are safe. It’s all part of the process of preparing them for the moment when they are woken up.",
    "“Some patients do wake up saying, ‘I remember your voice,’” says Kulwant Dhadwal. “They wake up with some kind of memory.”",
    "But the process with Covid-19 has proved even more delicate and difficult than normal, partly because so many ICU patients were on mechanical ventilators for extraordinarily long periods of time.",
    "Many of them woke up profoundly weak, although some regained strength unexpectedly quickly.",
    "“Usually when somebody’s been asleep for 40 days or more, it takes six weeks or longer for them to be totally free of the ventilator, to be ready to even start walking or standing,” Kulwant Dhadwal says.",
    "“But some of these patients were making progress within a week, which we found very unusual, very specific to this disease.”",
    "Another challenge in the immediate recovery from critical illness with Covid-19 is the severe inflammation.",
    "Many patients can’t cope with a breathing tube inserted through the mouth because the larynx and the area above the vocal cords are badly swollen as part of the illness. That means doctors have often had to often perform tracheostomies, creating an opening in the neck to gain access to the windpipe, in order to remove the breathing tube that connects patents to the ventilator.",
    "“You’ve got to look after the tracheostomy, it’s a wound in the neck,” explains Carl Waldmann, a consultant in intensive care at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading.",
    "“So, it was a long, slow process getting them off the ventilator. It might take them a week or two weeks or even longer.”",
    "“I WAS NEARLY A GONER”",
    "And behind every observation lies a human story.",
    "Abraham Raskin’s family were told in late April that it was unlikely he would survive. But on 12 June he finally left the Royal London Hospital after more than 50 days in intensive care, a tracheostomy, and a month in a medically induced coma.",
    "“The very fact that I’m alive now is a miracle,” he says, “I was nearly a goner.”",
    "On a video call arranged by nurses on 18 May his family saw his face for the first time since he was taken into hospital in early April. He wasn’t able to say anything, but he did raise an eyebrow.",
    "Abraham was severely delirious for some time after waking up. “I was talking all kinds of rubbish,” he says.",
    "“Afterwards when I heard about what I was saying, I felt like I was mad or something. It’s not pleasant.”",
    "But he is now back at home, still very tired, and following a basic exercise programme planned from him by a physiotherapist. With support from family members, he can get upstairs to sleep at night.",
    "“Some people can’t really walk anymore when they come out of this,” he says, “and some take months to recover. I hope I’m not one of them.”",
    " ",
    "Delirium",
    "As many as three-quarters of intensive care patients who need mechanical ventilation to help them breathe will suffer from delirium. And the observations of many doctors suggest that delirium has been particularly acute, and hallucinations unusually vivid, for people who fall critically ill with Covid-19.",
    "Delirium can be caused by the infection itself, and the fevers which accompany it. But it is intensified by the strong sedative drugs that have to be used to keep patients comfortable, and the unsettling environment of intensive care they find themselves in.",
    "While patients are in a coma, and after they wake up and begin withdrawing from these drugs, they often experience frightening hallucinations, and cling to unsettling beliefs about what is going on.",
    "“Delirium doesn’t have a dreamlike quality,” says Dorothy Wade, the principal health psychologist in intensive care at University College Hospital in London. “Patients always say ‘it was completely real - I was just living in this terrifying alternative reality.’”",
    "Doctors think that chemical imbalances prompt the brain to create its own explanation for why the body can’t move and the patient can’t speak. Often people think they’ve been kidnapped or tortured, or they think they’re in a prison cell about to be put on trial.",
    "“They tend to feel that the nurses and the doctors and the staff are all in some conspiracy,” says Dorothy Wade, “that this is all part of a conspiracy to make money out of them by selling their blood or their organs.”",
    "It means that psychologists like Dr Wade try to step in as early as possible. It’s important not to argue with delirious patients, she says, but instead to try to offer reassurance about what has really been happening.",
    "Simon Farrell left hospital relatively quickly after being taken off a ventilator, but he still recalls the vivid nature of the delirium he experienced.",
    "“I remember Elliott, my younger son, coming into the room in PPE,” he says. “Now, that clearly wasn’t right. No children were allowed on the ward. The hospital was locked down. It didn’t happen.”",
    "In his head at the time, though, he believed it to be absolutely true.",
    "“You just feel it is what’s happening,” he says. “And there was a lot worse than that. That was a simple one.”",
    " ",
    "Family",
    "The challenge of dealing with the acute delirium that accompanies Covid-19 has been heightened by the fact that family members can’t be at the bedside when patients are trying to return to reality. Seriously ill people wake into a world of flashing lights and machines, of disrupted sleep and hospital staff in full PPE.",
    "“It has a huge impact on patients,” explains Krystyna Walton, a consultant in rehabilitation medicine at the Salford Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester. “They are already confused, and it must be incredibly difficult.”",
    "“If somebody has suffered encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and they have memory problems or insight problems, they’re not aware of the way that Covid has affected the world, so they can’t understand why there are no visitors.”",
    "And the social isolation imposed by the pandemic also has repercussions for friends and family.",
    "Hannah Farrell, Simon’s wife, works as a neuro physiotherapist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where he was a patient. She recalls one evening when he was still severely delirious, a nurse she knew rang and suggested that hearing her voice on the phone might calm Simon down.",
    "“Apparently, it settled Simon, but it certainly didn’t settle me,” she says. “I didn’t sleep all night, because Simon just didn’t sound like Simon at all.”",
    "“For me, it was quite upsetting, and I’m sure other relatives have said the same.”",
    " ",
    "Long-term problems",
    "Some patients can still be delirious weeks after waking up.",
    "And delirium, says Kate Tantam, along with other frightening early experiences, “is the key link to post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression” among people who survive their time in ICU.",
    "Roughly one in five people who pass through intensive care in normal times go on to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). And the signs are that with Covid patients that number could be considerably higher.",
    "The same goes for more general anxiety and depression after leaving hospital. The extreme circumstances of the Covid pandemic, and the social isolation that has come with it, are likely to make things worse.",
    "The lack of a reassuring family presence, for example, continues to pose additional problems after patients are released from acute hospital wards into care homes and rehabilitation units. Hospitals have invested in iPads to facilitate contact, and family liaison teams make sure video calls take place every day, but it’s not quite the same.",
    "Krystyna Walton gives the example of one of her patients who had severe Covid pneumonia, as well as renal failure and dialysis.",
    "The patient spent several weeks in critical care, and several more on a medical ward before being moved to a rehabilitation ward with cognitive deficits. They have not been able to see their family for three months.",
    "Normally in a rehabilitation unit, staff would try to personalise a patient’s surroundings and encourage them to wear their own clothes. But the restrictions surrounding Covid have prevented much of that.",
    "And because family members are unable to visit, or speak to medical staff face-to-face, they often struggle to understand just how sick their relative has been.",
    "“There are no visitors in care homes, there are no visitors in rehabilitation in the NHS or in the independent sector,” says Krystyna Walton.",
    "“And even after leaving rehab there have been restrictions that we all have had to deal with, which makes it more difficult to visit a vulnerable person in their own home. All of this has a huge psychological impact.”",
    "So, the NHS is going to have to prepare for the possibility of a fresh wave of PTSD patients, just as it is trying to deal with a backlog of mental health (and other) cases which have been neglected during the worst of the pandemic.",
    "“We won’t know for several months how big a problem this is going to be,” says Dorothy Wade.",
    "“To begin with people are very relieved to be out of hospital, especially after such a long stay. Sometimes it can take quite a long time for them to realise that something still isn’t quite right.”",
    "It doesn’t always turn out that way. Alongside post-traumatic stress, doctors acknowledge the concept of post-traumatic growth, and point to patients who emerge from critical care with a new outlook on life.",
    "“There are some people who - no matter how difficult this has been - find themselves in a more positive frame of mind,” explains Julie Highfield, a consultant clinical psychologist based in intensive care units in Cardiff.",
    "“People feel this is a chance they never thought they would have, and they are determined to live their life well.”",
    "Simon Farrell is certainly trying to focus on the positive and he has been recovering week by week. But he admits it has to be tinged with realism.",
    "“I think people feel if they get physically stronger, they’re then mentally stronger and they’re fine. And that’s not always the case. The two are not aligned.”",
    "CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH",
    "Physical Recovery",
    "For many people physical recovery can provide the biggest challenge, particularly if they have spent weeks in intensive care.",
    "“Covid is a nasty, nasty disease that kicks every single system you’ve got in the neck,” says Kate Tantam.",
    "And sometimes when people wake up from four weeks of sedation, like thousands of Covid-19 patients have done, the only thing they can move is their fingertips.",
    "“We have to rebuild everything with them,” she says, “and teach them how to do everything physically again - from being able to feed yourself or being able to touch your hair, to being able to stand and being able to sit.”",
    "A prolonged period of recovery is not unusual after intensive care, but many Covid-19 patients have experienced particularly severe fatigue and muscle wasting. They are exhausted - sitting in a chair for half an hour might be followed by four hours sleep. And rebuilding muscle takes time.",
    "“If we don’t give patients the right level of nutritional input, they are not going to recover,” Kate Tantam says.",
    "So, dieticians have an important role to play, alongside physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists. If you have just survived a multi-system disease which attacks different parts of the body in different ways, it stands to reason that you need various forms of help to recover.",
    "Many Covid patients will return to normal life relatively quickly. But some have suffered kidney failure and may require ongoing renal support, while others will need to be referred to cardiologists or may have developed neurological conditions that require specialist care.",
    "The challenge, says Carl Waldmann, “is to make sure that everyone gets what they need, and that the right support can be provided at the right time.”",
    "“I think the greatest burden will be in the community,” argues Krystyna Walton, “because many of these patients will have quite subtle deficits that will only become evident to them as they start recovering physically, weeks and months after going home.”",
    " ",
    "Breathlessness",
    "The most common physical challenge for recovering Covid-19 patients is shortness of breath - and that can apply to people who had moderate as well as severe symptoms of the disease.",
    "“For patients that are coming out of hospital,” says Sally Singh, “clearly they’re breathless because they’ve had a respiratory disease. Their lungs are temporarily damaged, but they are also deconditioned because they’ve been lying in a hospital bed for so long that they’ve become pretty unfit.”",
    "It means that simple things like going up and down stairs can become extremely challenging, especially in elderly patients.",
    "But breathlessness is an issue that goes well beyond survivors of intensive care. And a significant minority of people who’ve been infected with the coronavirus are still struggling to shake it off.",
    " ",
    "\"I'd crash in a heap\"",
    "Jenny Goldblatt, an infectious diseases doctor at the Royal Free Hospital, fell ill with Covid-19 in March and it has lingered ever since - returning in waves of fatigue, chest pains and breathing difficulties.",
    "She spent a couple of days in hospital in March, where she was given a little extra oxygen. But it was only after going home that her problems began in earnest.",
    "“Every 10 days or so I’d start to feel a little better and I’d start to go for longer walks,” she says. “But then I’d crash in a heap and couldn’t get out of bed for a week.”",
    "It was a month after falling ill that she first managed to walk to the end of the road and back. A keen cyclist, her next goal is to cycle around the block.",
    "“I can’t imagine when I will be able to take my bike for a proper ride, and if I think about that too much it gets a bit depressing.”",
    "Jenny thinks she has cleared the virus, and she has “easily detectable” antibodies in her blood, but her body is continuing to react in unusual ways. Post-viral fatigue is not unique to Covid-19, but this is something more.",
    "Jenny has suffered chest pains and breathlessness; other patients with lingering symptoms report severe headaches or abdominal pains. Three months after falling ill, going back to work or resuming normal life is out of the question.",
    "“I am getting better slowly,” she says, “but I can’t be too ambitious. It is frustrating to be on this rollercoaster, with absolutely no idea how long the journey will take.”",
    " ",
    "Challenges:",
    "Previous medical experience with pneumonia suggests it can take months, or in extreme cases years, for patients to get back to where they were before. With Covid-19, we are still early in the cycle of rehabilitation and recovery, and every patient is different.",
    "“The honest answer is we don’t yet know how long it will take,” says Sally Singh. “People are researching that as we speak - monitoring chest x-rays, symptoms and the wellbeing of patients to help us identify what the best intervention to support these people may be.”",
    "The trouble is the provision of rehabilitation services across the country can be patchy, especially for people emerging from critical care. And the NHS is already dealing with a massive backlog of non-Covid cases that have been delayed.",
    "“The huge challenge,” says Krystyna Walton, “is going to be the increase in numbers.”",
    "At the peak of the outbreak the priority was to get patients out of acute hospital settings quickly to free up bed space. That means in many cases the rehabilitation assessments that would normally be done in hospital would have been done in the community, or in a care home or a non-specialist rehabilitation setting.",
    "“And my suspicion,” Krystyna Walton adds, “is that many patients may have not had their needs assessed properly.”",
    "Carl Waldmann, who has been working on improving the rehabilitation of seriously ill patients for more than 25 years, says one of the best analogies he can think of is building a rocket, and training an astronaut.",
    "“You put them up into space, but you also have to think about where they’re going to land and what we’re going to do when they get back.”",
    "It is the same, he says, if you put a patient through the complexities of intensive care.",
    "“We’ve had some patients who need seven specialists looking after them afterwards,” he says, “and unless they have all those bits of the jigsaw puzzle, there is a chance they won’t make the recovery they could have made.”",
    "It is important to emphasise those rehabilitation needs don’t stop after the immediate recovery period. Many patients will suffer from a permanent and often debilitating condition. Doctors also know that a significant number of people who have been critically ill have suffered cognitive deficits. Ideally, they should have screening for return to driving a vehicle, and for return to work.",
    "“Rehabilitation has to sort of blur into real life and getting back out into the community,” says Krystyna Walton, “doing what you used to do before, looking after your family, earning an income, enjoying leisure facilities and exercise.”",
    "“And that is what takes time and expertise.”",
    "The NHS and individual hospitals are of course building rehabilitation into their Covid recovery plans, but this is a system that has been overlooked for years. Experts in the field hope, despite all the pressures, that Covid will provide a launch pad for change.",
    "“Hospitals are very good at treating people, doing something to somebody to make them better,” says Kate Tantam. “But what they are not always very good at is prioritising the therapeutic and rehabilitation input afterwards.”",
    "It is, in other words, not just about survival, it is about health-related quality of life.",
    "“There is no point giving somebody a massive intensive care stay, if you don’t try to return them to where they want to be.”"

    "India-China Conflict: In Galwan, why are we pulling back?"
  ],
  "date_published": [
    " Jul 08 2020, 00:10 ist"
  ],
  "content": [
    "India and China are said to have set in motion a ‘mutual disengagement’ process. Troops on both sides have reportedly begun pulling back from Galwan Valley in Ladakh, and they are expected to do so next in the Hot Springs area, even as the Pangong Tso remains an area of concern for India. In Galwan Valley, both sides have pulled back by 1.8 km from the June 15 face-off site. The Chinese have dismantled tents and other infrastructure erected here. While the Chinese pullback and the de-escalation along the LAC are welcome, there is little reason for India to draw satisfaction from events unfolding in Ladakh. Contrary to claims that India held its ground in the talks between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and China’s State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, it does seem that India has ceded territory to the Chinese. India’s stated position on the Galwan Valley is that this area is on the Indian side of the LAC.  Then, why has India pulled back 1.8 km from the face-off site here? And why did it agree to a ‘buffer zone’, again in what is Indian territory? Over the past two months, the PLA systematically occupied territory on the Indian side of the LAC. Beijing has now made a grand show of pulling back a bit. But it has gained territory overall in the ‘mutual disengagement process’. This is classic Chinese strategy. By agreeing to this farcical pull-out, the Narendra Modi government seems unable to reverse the Chinese land-grab in Ladakh.",
    "India has much to worry about. A Chinese official statement after the Doval-Wang talks makes no mention of any agreement on disengaging troops. Further, Beijing has not withdrawn its claim over Galwan but has reaffirmed that it “will continue to vigorously defend its territorial sovereignty…in the border areas.” The ground situation points to continuing Chinese pressure. PLA troop presence in other sectors remains high. Besides, Beijing recently raised its territorial dispute with Bhutan even as it meddles in the internal politics of Nepal and instigates anti-India moves there. These are attempts to pile up additional pressure on India.",
    "Weeks after both sides pulled back their troops from the standoff site at Doklam in 2017, PLA troops returned and resumed building infrastructure there. Likewise, on June 6, the two sides agreed to pull back from Galwan Valley, but the PLA stayed put, culminating in the face-off a little over a week later. India must draw lessons from these experiences. It cannot lower its guard. Importantly, rather than covering up its blunders at the border, the government should ensure that India’s territory is not lost to China."

    "Custodial Torture: Affront to our conscience"
  ],
  "date_published": [
    " Jul 08 2020, 01:37 ist"
  ],
  "content": [
    "In May 2017, the then Attorney General of India told representatives from countries at the UN’s Human Rights Council that “the concept of torture is completely alien to our culture and it has no place in the governance of the nation.” Last week, Bennix, 31, and his father, Jayaraj, 58, were brutally tortured in a police station in Tamil Nadu’s Sathankulam town in Thoothukudi district.",
    "The father-son duo succumbed to the custodial torture on June 23. Their crime? Extending the business hours of their mobile accessories shop beyond lockdown hours. Their death from police brutality is an affront to both the conscience of the people and the conscience of the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty and dignity in equal measure to all.",
    "As per the first information report, Bennix and Jayaraj were accused of Sections 188, 269, 294(b), 353, and 506(2) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). These are all bailable offences (except Section 506) but both of them died even before bail could be sought. Many lawyers have raised questions about the conduct of the Sathankulam Judicial Magistrate, B Saravanan, in this case. These are valid questions and must be repeatedly asked.",
    "Under the Indian criminal justice system, the police do not have sweeping powers of arrest and the Magistrate must exercise his judicial mind before making a remand order. The police must clearly list out the grounds necessitating arrest and the Magistrate must carefully peruse those grounds. The Magistrate must physically examine the accused to rule out custodial violence or any kind of medical unfitness in general.",
    "In the instant case, there was a colossal and unconscionable dereliction of judicial duty and propriety on the part of the Magistrate. As per reports, he did not physically examine the accused persons and proceeded to make a remand order in a routine and cavalier manner. The Magistrate is the first line of defence on issues of fundamental rights and his power, role and conduct must undoubtedly be discussed and debated.",
    "But the Sathankulam incident must reignite the debate on the larger issue of custodial torture and custodial deaths and the impunity with which the police act.",
    "According to a recent report by National Campaign Against Torture, 1,731 people died in custody in 2019 alone (that is, five custodial deaths a day). The 2018 NCRB data reveals that the state of Tamil Nadu accounted for the second highest custodial deaths in the country.",
    "Importantly, these are conservative figures because the majority of cases go unreported. The police are not mandatorily required to report (to NHRC) cases of custodial violence that do not result in deaths. The names of most victims do not go viral and their family members are the only ones to lament their deaths. Often, police delinquency merely leads to suspensions, transfers, or reproach. Few delinquent police officers are arrested and even fewer face punishment.",
    "Much of this immunity is attributable to how the procedural aspects of the current criminal justice system work in practice. In theory, the law provides for several safeguards, such as physical examination of the accused, the right of the accused to be presented before a Magistrate, the right to legal representation, the right to meet family members, the right against self-incrimination, and the right to silence, among others. In practice, however, these safeguards are routinely flouted.",
    "A police officer is supposedly immune from accountability because custodial interrogations are the prerogative of the police, who can easily manipulate or bury evidence. Interrogations take place behind closed doors and there is no eyewitness. The archaic methods to detect torture have also outlived their utility. Surprise inspections by official or non-official visitors (NOVs) seldom take place. Most police stations do not have adequate, functional CCTV cameras.",
    "Custodial interrogations are not electronically recorded. Custodial torture is widely accepted as normative behaviour and is considered to be a part of investigation. So much so that custodial torture is not a specific offence by name under the IPC. While India has signed the UN Convention against Torture (UNCAT), the government has not, till date, shown the courage or the will to introduce a standalone legislation on custodial torture.",
    "Currently, no Indian law defines “torture” or “custodial torture”. This is so despite categorical recommendations to that effect from a Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha, the National Human Rights Commission and the Law Commission. The existing provisions under the IPC and the Code of Criminal Procedure are inadequate and lacking in necessary specificity to address all kinds of custodial violence.",
    "What India needs today is standalone legislation on custodial torture and not tokenistic amendments to Sections 330 and 331 of the IPC (on extorting confessions). Unfortunately, there has been no clear attempt in bringing the Indian law in conformity with the UNCAT. In 2016, former law minister and Supreme Court lawyer Ashwani Kumar filed a PIL in the Supreme Court seeking that India meet its constitutional and international commitment to prevent custodial torture and violence.  ",
    "That petition rightly pointed that the absence of a standalone, comprehensive and purposeful legislation in India for prevention of custodial violence has resulted in a disturbing void in law endangering the constitutional right of persons affected by custodial violence and torture. Kumar’s petition was, however, disposed of after the Attorney General told the court that the government was “seriously considering” the Law Commission’s recommendations in the matter.",
    "Since then, no concrete action has been taken by the government in this regard. The absence of a standalone legislation on custodial torture means that the Supreme Court’s guidelines issued in the DK Basu case (1997) remain a matter of mere academic interest for decades. There is no system in place to speedily prosecute delinquent police officers, to lodge complaints relating to custodial torture, to deal with the issue of evidence and burden of proof, to ensure speedy and fair investigation into custodial violence, to speedily dispose of complaints, to protect witnesses and complainants, to detect custodial violence using advanced scientific methods, or to sensitise police officers.",
    "Custodial torture is one of the worst forms of barbarism. The rule of law cannot survive when protectors turn into oppressors. Any form of custodial treatment or behaviour that is degrading and contrary to human dignity strikes a heavy blow at Article 21 of the Constitution.",
    "The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court is monitoring the statutory magisterial probe into the custodial torture of the father-son duo and we will have to wait and see if appropriate punishment is meted out to those involved in the gruesome crime. The right against torture is a non-negotiable fundamental of the Constitution and Parliament must soon take a firm stand on this issue.",

    "Petrol price on July 3 in Delhi was 80.43 a litre, a Rs 9.13 increase in 28 days, from June 6, and has stayed there since even as diesel price, now higher than that of petrol, continues to inch upwards as prices change every day at 6 am.  ",
    "Why are petrol and diesel prices so high? Is it due to the high import cost and a weakening rupee? It is true that crude price of the Indian basket (what the country imports) increased from $19.90 a barrel in March closer to $40 now. And the rupee has fallen – from Rs 75.27 to the dollar to almost Rs 76. At this increased crude and dollar rates, a barrel (159 litres) of crude oil costs Rs 2,325, which works out to Rs 14.62 a litre. So, import cost and weak rupee are not the reasons for the rise in petrol and diesel prices at the pump.",
    "Unfounded excuses",
    "Not just today, but these excuses for rising prices have been invalid ever since the government withdrew its price determination role, or the administered prices mechanism. We are made to believe that the high crude prices are the culprit whereas there is no link between crude import price and the price at the pump. Consider the situation in 2013, when crude price was at a high $111.59.  At the then prevailing rupee-dollar exchange rate of Rs 66.89, the per-barrel crude rate was Rs 7,464 and per litre Rs 46.94. But petrol in Delhi was sold at Rs 76.06 then. Similarly, in 2018 the per litre cost, factoring in the extant exchange rate and the crude price at that time, was Rs 33.90, but petrol was still sold at Rs 76.",
    "Even in April 2020, when crude price bottomed out to $19.90 and dollar exchange rate was Rs 75.27, imported crude cost Rs 9.42 a litre, but petrol was still being sold at over Rs 70.",
    "The second reason often given for the high fuel prices is the heavy subsidies the government gives to the oil sector. The government’s compiled figures, petroleum and natural gas statistics, themselves refute this claim. The oil sector contributed Rs 4,56,530 crore to the government in 2017-18. The contribution included: Royalty from crude oil (Rs 12,057 crore), royalty from gas (Rs 1722 crore), Oil Development Cess (Rs 13,544 crore), Excise and Custom duties (Rs 2,13,012 crore), sales tax (Rs 1,86,394 crore) and dividend (Rs 29,801 crore). Similarly, the provisional estimates of gains for 2018-19 is Rs 4,33,062 crore.",
    "Oil pays for all subsidies",
    "As per the government’s data, the share of the petroleum sector in total subsidies has increased from 8.3% (Rs 24,833 crore Revised Estimate) in 2018-19 to 11.1% (Rs 37,478 crore) crore in 2019-20 Budget Estimate. But this amount is peanuts compared to what the government gets from the sector, more than Rs 4 lakh crore! The total subsidy of the government in 2017-18 amounted to Rs 2,24,455 crore, which included the subsidy on food (Rs 1,00,282 crore), fertilizers (Rs 66,468 crore), petroleum (Rs 24,460 crore), interest subsidies (Rs 22,146 crore) and other subsidies (Rs 11,099 crore). The total subsidy budgeted for 2019-20 was Rs 3,38,949 crore. This means, the petroleum sector is taking on it the entire subsidy burden of the government.",
    "High profits to companies",
    "Similarly, the claim of the oil companies sustaining losses is baseless. On the contrary, they are making huge profits. As per the latest official data, the net profit earned by public sector oil companies during 2018-19 was Rs 69,714 crore, which was higher than Rs 69,562 crore in 2017-18; ONGC earned the highest profit of Rs 26,716 crore, followed by IOCL, Rs 16,894 crore, and BPCL Rs 7,132 crore. So, the excuse of losses is an outright false claim.",
    "The under-recoveries, to whatever extent they are shown, are also not losses. In simple terms, the under-recoveries are the difference between the actual price the petroleum product is sold at and a notional price, a lower than expected profit, but not loss.",
    "Another reason often quoted for high fuel prices is India’s high dependence on crude imports. It is true that India’s dependence on imports is high, but it is not a justifiable cause for high petrol, diesel and other product prices. True, domestic production of crude is only 34.20 million metric tons (MMT) against the consumption of 213.22 MMT (2018-19 figures), which means an 84% import dependence. But India imports more crude than is domestically consumed. It refines the additional volume and sells the products outside India.",
    "The Petroleum Oil and Lubricants (POL) exports in 2018-19 were worth Rs 2,67,697 crore; the weak rupee gives additional benefit here, which is not much talked about. Petroleum product exports account for 11.6% of the country’s total exports Rs 23,07,663 crore. So, import dependence is not a good excuse for high petrol and diesel prices.",
    "There is, therefore, no justification in not sharing the benefits of low international crude prices with the people by lowering the prices of petrol and diesel. Needless to add, the high petrol and diesel prices have a high cascading effect on prices in general and have the potential to further cripple the Covid-19 ravaged economy. The government will do well to review its fuel pricing policy and make it transparent at least now, and should stop the constant rise in petrol and diesel prices and thereby of other goods.",

    "Markets regulator Sebi is looking at permitting futures trading in petrol and diesel, an official said emphasising that there has been no disruption in commodities derivatives trading during the Covid-19 crisis.",
    "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is also looking at re-allowing futures trade in tur and urad, which were banned in 2007 after a spike in prices of these commodities.",
    "\"Yes, all products that I mentioned over here (tur and urad weather indices), including petrol and diesel, are being looked into,\" Sebi General Manager (Commodity Segment) Chhavi Kapoor said at a webinar hosted by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI).",
    "She added that many products are in the pipeline, and given the market conditions, these products will be looked into. \"I cannot say whether these products will come or not.\"",
    "Currently, futures trading is allowed in crude oil. Petrol and diesel are, among others, the two major refinery products derived from crude oil.",
    "Earlier too, there was an industry demand to allow futures trade in these two petroleum products. Sebi had sent the proposal to the petroleum ministry.",
    "On this issue, PHDCCI President D K Aggarwal said, \"This is a sensitive issue. I do not know whether Sebi or the ministry will be comfortable.\"",
    "He said prices of petrol and diesel in India are affected by local taxes, which comprise 70 per cent of the total cost. Suppose a retail price of diesel is Rs 72 per litre, the cost of taxes itself comes to about Rs 50.",
    "\"Since these two products affect most industries and the entire economy, I think allowing these products will help in hedging the prices. As a market participant, we would like to have these products,\" he added.",
    "Earlier, responding to a query on making corporate hedging compulsory in commodities derivatives markets by banks, the Sebi official said such a proposal is under a discussion stage with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).",
    "\"It is still under discussion with the RBI... It cannot be mandated by Sebi alone. Both the regulators have to come on board on this issue,\" she said.",
    "Right now, Sebi has asked the corporates to disclose their hedging details in their annual reports. These disclosures form a basis for further talks with the RBI, she added.",
    "On allowing derivative trading commodities such as skimmed milk powder (SMP), the Sebi official said it is ready to consider new products if industry submits a proposal after a thorough research and justifying its need.",
    "The government list of 91 notified commodities on which exchanges can launch commodities for trading, cannot be \"sacrosanct\", she said adding that the exchanges should look at new products learning from the current Covid-19 crisis.",
    "\"Covid-19 has been a big jolt, but it is also an opportunity for all of us to learn what we can do in future so that a pandemic of this kind will not affect the market,\" she said and noted that there has been no disruption as such in the commodities market as people have been able to trade smoothly."

But the HDUDA agreed to use industrial area for commercial activities,\" Kalburgi told media persons.",
    "CA sites, layouts",
    "Kalburgi said, there is a rule to leave 10% land as CA site in a layout, but some layouts have scattered CA sites. Now, it is decided to reserve 10% CA site at one place itself. This would made mandatory for 113 newly proposed private layouts, he noted.",
    "As many as 57 unauthorised layouts are already identified, and 100 more such layouts are expected to be traced out. They would be demolished. Out of around 350 CA sites allotted, some are misused, and they would be taken back. If CA sites are unused for long time, they would be asked whether sites would be used for the purpose allotted or should be taken back. Survey in this regard is on, Kalburgi said.",
    "The revised comprehensive development plan (CDP) was approved last year, and a team is coming to rectify the errors in six months. Master plan implementation would begin within one year, he assured.",
    "Jagadish Shettar instructed Kalburgi not to stop unauthorised layout demolition abruptly. It should continue, and all elected representatives would support that. Farmers have not yet come forward to give their land to develop HDUDA layout, he said.",

  "content": [
    "How did lithium – a metal integral to modern life, thanks to long duration batteries – come to the Earth?",
    "This has been a long-held scientific puzzle that has now been cracked by astrophysicists from Bengaluru in collaboration with their international partners.",
    "Analysing data from a galactic survey of 100,000 stars, researchers at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics have discovered that all low-mass Sun-like stars produce lithium from an internal process known as helium flash when the gas was cooked at high temperature inside the stellar ovens.",
    "Such lithium generating stars would have a mass of up to two Solar masses or twice the weight of the Sun.",
    "The discovery published in the Nature Astronomy on Monday sets aside a four-decades old theory according to which only 1% of the stars produce lithium though little was known about the process.",
    "“Our discovery shows that any low mass stars where helium flash takes place will produce lithium. This challenges the long held idea that stars only destroy lithium during their lifetime. Our work also implies that the Sun itself will manufacture lithium in the future, which is not predicted by any models, indicating that there is some physical process missing in stellar theory.” B Eswar Reddy, IIA professor and one of the authors of the paper told DH.",
    "The origin of lithium - the only metal created from the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago – was a mystery because stars with temperature of 2.5 million degrees Kelvin annihilate it, leaving the scientists to wonder where it comes from.",
    "Over the course of time, the lithium content in the physical Universe has increased by about a factor of four which is meager compared to the rest of the elements like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, nickel and so on which grew about a million times over the lifetime of the Universe.",
    "Stars are primary contributors to this significant enhancement of these heavier elements through mass ejections and stellar explosions. Lithium, however, is understood to be an exemption! As per the current understanding, based on today’s best models, lithium in stars like the Sun only gets destroyed over their lifetime.",
    "\"This was a great puzzle that existed for four decades because as soon as lithium was produced, it was destroyed,” Reddy said.",
    "Partnering with the researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Monash University, Australia and Institute for Advanced Studies, Princeton, the Bengaluru astrophysicists have not only demonstrated the genesis of lithium in the cosmic cauldrons, but also proposed an explanation for the underlying process.",
    "\"The result is potentially very important for the cosmos since the observations question the existing wisdom that limits the amount of lithium that could be expected to be formed and retained in stars (stellar nucleosysnthesis). It points to possible lack of understanding how light nuclei like lithium are cooked in the stellar furnaces,\" commented astrophysicist Tarun Sourdeep, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research, Pune, who is not associated with the study.",
    "Reddy said the work is far from over as the team would now seek to find an answer to another mystery – how did the lithium survive in such stars with superlative temperature."

    "Perhaps ultimately the number that matters most is the virus count. Half a million people are dead - a fifth of them in the world's biggest economy. Controlling that spread may be what determines Trump's re-election chances.",
    "For all those reasons, markets are see-sawing between risk-on/risk-off, said David Arnaud, a fund manager at Canada Life Investments.",

  "content": [
    "A single shot every two months prevents HIV better than the most commonly used daily pill, Truvada, researchers reported Tuesday.",
    "At the moment, Truvada and Descovy, made by Gilead Sciences, are the only drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for prevention of HIV infection, a strategy called PrEP. Gilead has heavily been criticized for setting a high price for the pills.",
    "Additional options for prevention are sorely needed, to say nothing of a cure. About 1.7 million people became infected with HIV in 2019, bringing the global total to 38 million.",
    "Many people are unable or unwilling to take a daily pill to prevent HIV infection, particularly in low-income countries where the coronavirus pandemic is disrupting services and access to antiretroviral drugs.",
    "“I think it’s revolutionary,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, a researcher at Harvard University, said of the findings.",
    "“It’s exciting to have another pharma company in the PrEP mix,” she added. “This will create competition and ideally drives costs down.”",
    "The randomized, double-blind trial of the drug, called cabotegravir, was conducted by the HIV Prevention Trials Network, a scientific collaborative. The trial included nearly 4,600 cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men and was conducted at 43 sites in seven countries.",
    "Each of the participants got a shot every two months, either cabotegravir or a placebo. Each participant also took either Truvada or a placebo pill every day.",
    "The trial was expected to continue well into 2022, but it was stopped in May after an interim analysis showed that cabotegravir was highly effective.",
    "In the final analysis, 13 participants who got the injections every eight weeks were infected with HIV, compared with 39 who were infected among those who took the daily pill. The shot was 66% more effective than Truvada.",
    "In a subset of 372 people receiving Truvada, blood tests showed that just 75% faithfully took the pills. The injection proved more effective than the pills for these participants, too.",
    "Dr. Kimberly Smith, head of research and development at Viiv Healthcare, maker of the drug, said the company expected to file for FDA approval in early 2021.",
    "Truvada is expected to be available in generic form next year, Walensky said, and Viiv Healthcare should set a low price for cabotegravir, because the competitors will be increasingly inexpensive.",
    "“I would say the competition here is generic Truvada, not branded Truvada,” she said."

    "In yet another revenue generation measure, the Revenue department has issued an order permitting the sale of government land leased to various religious, industrial and other organisations.",
    "Officials say that around Rs 2,250 crore will be generated in Bengaluru Urban district alone, if the order is implemented.",
    "While rules for the process are yet to be formed, it has directed deputy commissioners of various districts to submit proposals for the sale of such lands leased by the government to various institutions under the Karnataka Land Grant Rules, 1969. The order came after a recent Cabinet decision. ",
    "The order issued on July 6 says that government lands leased to private organisations, trusts, industries, educational, social welfare, religious and agricultural purposes can be regularised by paying the guidance value of the land, provided the organisation continued to use the land for the same purpose it was granted for.",
    "If an organisation or trust wanted to convert the land for other purposes, it will be charged twice the guidance value. According to the order, land leased to organisations that are unwilling to purchase the land will be surveyed. “DCs should initiate measures to survey such lands and recover the unused land to the government,” it said.",
    "Revenue Principal Secretary N Manjunath Prasad told ",
    "DH",
    " that rules for the sale of such lands will be formulated shortly. “We have directed deputy commissioners to compile the extent of land leased to various organisations in their respective districts,” he said, noting that 921 acres were leased to private parties in Bengaluru Urban district.",
    "From the 921 acres, the state government used to receive an annual rent of Rs 6.50 crore per year. Sale of leased land in Bengaluru Urban alone will generate around Rs 2,250 crore at current guidance values, Prasad said. ",
    "The government is also pushing for regularisation of unauthorised buildings on Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) land and auction of corner sites to mobilise resources due to the severe economic difficulties in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the state’s reduced share in central taxes."
