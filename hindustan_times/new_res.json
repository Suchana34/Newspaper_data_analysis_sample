    "Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi recently announced that India must become ",
    "(self-reliant). One aspect of this could be that India will remove barriers within its internal markets to truly become a single market. It will remove the hurdles to efficiency improvements and become more competitive. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was a step in this direction. Recent decisions to remove hurdles in inter-state agricultural trade are also similar. For agricultural and industrial products, as well as capital, India is increasingly becoming a single market. The creation of a barrier-free domestic market is also an intent reflected in Article 301 of the Constitution.",
    "However, there is one market where frictions are being added rather than reduced. This is the labour market. For different reasons, leaders from out-migration and in-migration states have made statements suggesting that there may be more impediments to the inter-state migration of workers. Some states have announced preferential treatment for workers from within the state. Others have spoken of instituting an approval system before allowing their workers to move to other states, in the backdrop of how they were treated.",
    "There are compelling reasons for internal migration in India.",
    "First, India has much higher economic differences across states than comparable countries — with the per capita income of the richest large state (Haryana) being more than six times that of the poorest state (Bihar). The wage gap between states is as high as 100% for regular workers and 250% for casual workers. It is, therefore, no wonder that workers from the poorer states migrate to richer states for work. As of now, the best option for many poor people looking to escape poverty is to leave the states they live in, because of economic opportunities in richer states. This movement is difficult since the cost of living is also higher in richer states. However, millions still migrate and brave squalid conditions in in-migration states because they need livelihoods.",
    "Second, some of the poorer states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have younger and larger populations, with many more workers than work opportunities. While these states must develop their economies, in the short-term, migration is an essential component of development for them.",
    "Third, India’s growth has been largely services-led. For most services, the availability of physical labour is essential. For services such as cooking, driving, hairdressing and security, there is a need for workers to be physically present to provide the service.",
    "While beneficial for migrants, migration also has negative implications. Migration can put downward pressure on wages in richer states, with the increase in the supply of workers. This creates an incentive for regional and local leaders to generate anti-migrant sentiments, and to promote policies that favour local workers. This dynamic is not very different from the one seen in international migration — after a point, a political economy develops to oppose migration.",
    "Throughout India’s history, states have enacted laws and measures that are discriminatory vis-à-vis non-resident migrants. Many state laws discourage or prevent non-residents from applying for government jobs or other professions that require government licensing (auto, taxi licences), or deny them the benefits of educational reservations. Other laws, prevalent in some states of the Northeast, regulate the entry of non-residents within the state. Yet another category of laws prevents non-residents from owning property (such as in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and others). The Union government has recently announced “One Nation One Ration Card” because non-resident migrants are currently ineligible for many state welfare schemes.",
    "Even though Article 19(1)(d) of the Constitution guarantees free movement and residence, states have enacted “reasonable restrictions” to disfavour non-resident migrants. Article 16 outlaws discrimination in employment on the grounds of residence, but the criteria for determining reservations is usually linked to local demographic characteristics. The courts have also largely upheld positive discrimination in employment and education that nonetheless discriminates against non-residents. They have upheld not just residency as a ground for eligibility for jobs and educational seats, but also the charging of differential capitation fees based on residency. In doing so, courts have generally privileged the equality interests in the Constitution at the cost of free movement and residence.",
    "While such measures ostensibly serve to protect local constituents, they inhibit migration and thus the law of comparative advantage from operating to the benefit of in-migration states. Bengaluru could not have become a hub for information technology if it had imposed restrictions on the movement of skilled professional migrants who eventually settled in the city. Contrary to nativist sentiments, Karnataka’s population has been a net beneficiary of this in-migration because of the increased contribution of Bengaluru to Karnataka’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) besides the value of diversity.",
    "This benefit is not limited to skilled or high-end services. To the extent that Bengaluru’s economy powers Karnataka’s growth, a migrant hairdresser working in Bangalore is also important for the state’s economy. This was evident recently when the Karnataka government wanted to prevent migrants from leaving for their home states because of their importance to the construction industry. It is, therefore, time to seriously re-examine the legal framework that inhibits the movement of migrants across the country, and prevents them from accessing safety, shelter and welfare services on equal terms as residents."

    "India has the ",
    ", says a recent Harvard University assessment. If the Chinese attacked, co-author Frank O’Donnell of the US Naval War College told HT, “due to the larger permanent military presence of Indian forces vis-a-vis Chinese forces along the border areas, India would eventually be able to force China back across the LAC, although casualties would be extremely high on both sides.” One unknown in such a conflict would be China’s ability to use cyberattacks to disable Indian communications and logistics. ",
    "Over the past dozen years India has not only closed the gap with China in this military theatre, it may now have a slender superiority. Indian officials largely concur with this view though prefer to stress India does not enjoy a position of complete dominance. Chinese military assessments began recognizing this problem from the mid-2000s and this may have contributed its border belligerence. ",
    "India and China have a similar number of soldiers along the border, a little over 200,000 each, but a portion of Chinese troops are reserved for the Russian border and handling insurgents in Tibet and Xinjiang. India holds a slight edge in fighter aircraft numbers but, more importantly, its Su-30s are superior to any Chinese fighters in the area and its base network allows it to better survive the missile exchanges that would follow. “India has more and better aircraft along the border, more experienced air crews, as well as a resilient basing position,” says O’Donnell.",
    "“China is regularly operating with a permanent Indian conventional force advantage along its border areas,” says the report. It notes this is not “typically acknowledged” in Indian debates and optimists regarding the military balance against China were “a minority” in India. ",
    "For decades, going by the People’s Liberation Army’s journal, ",
    ", India was rated only as China’s number four external security concern. This has begun to change. The China National Defence Daily by 2013 spoke of India’s “surge of forces” along the border. A 2017 Nanfang Daily survey of Chinese strategic thinkers said some were worrying that “the defensive strategy of the Indian Army has shifted . . . toward the offensive.” Two Chinese experts on territorial issues warned in 2014 that “keeping our military’s advantage in the Sino-Indian border area is not only a national defense requirement, but also to prevent China from being disadvantaged in border negotiations.” There is more literature in the Chinese language about India catching up in terms of military infrastructure and force deployment after the Doklam crisis, says General G. L. Narasimhan Rao, head of the Centre for the Study of Contemporary China. ",
    "India is far from being in a position of military preponderance. Indian defence officials point to the “touch and go nature” of the mountain environment means a numerical advantage in men and aircraft can be wiped out by inclement weather. China keeps most of its military firepower along its Pacific coast and would almost certainly redeploy to go for a “round two,” warns O’Donnell. M. Taylor Fravel, an MIT professor who has written on China’s border policies, says that “China has just over 10 percent of its ground forces [in its western theatre], a very large part of the country, and not even all these troops are focused on India.” But because China does not want to deploy a large fraction of its forces in Tibet or Xinjiang, he added, “I think this disparity in the local balance makes China especially sensitive to changes that improves India’s position.” Did India’s steady military improvement trigger Beijing is harder to ascertain. O’Donnell thinks China’s greater border aggression is a general trend evident in its behaviour with all its neighbours and not just about India. "

    "On December 11, 1917, General Edmund Allenby entered the holy city of Jerusalem bareheaded and on foot, a feat which even the greatest English warrior King, Richard the Lionheart, and the crusaders were unable to achieve. Lining the street from Jaffa Gate to the city centre were Indian soldiers who had made it possible. Today, a 250-year-old, proud, experienced, and battle-hardened army with many achievements in war, counter-insurgency, internal disturbances and UN peacekeeping missions has been reduced to an unarmed, fist-fighting entity. With pain and anguish, the serving soldiers and veterans ask; where did it all go wrong? The obvious answer is that our policies over the years have come home to roost and haunt us.",
    "A soldier is armed and trained to fight with his weapon. A police force is meant to police. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the northern and central sectors is managed by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. It reports directly to the home ministry. Somewhere down the line, a decision was taken to strengthen the ITBP patrols with regular soldiers. This allowed the local commanders to remain abreast with the happenings on the LAC. In a period of peace and tranquility, regular soldiers had to per force follow the protocol of patrolling without weapons, leading to push and shove tactics as seen in its magnified form in Doklam.",
    "Policing the borders and preventing intrusions are different matters. The role of the military is defined and it must work within those parameters. Unarmed troops must not be sent to remove an intrusion. Dual responsibility and accountability between the ITBP and the army has been fully exploited by the Chinese.",
    "COMMAND AND CONTROL PROBLEMS",
    "We are in the process of improving infrastructure in the North-East and Ladakh for economic development and also to ward off the Chinese threat, but they have been ahead of us in this area. Heavy expenditure on these projects will go waste if we are unable to protect these against aggression. Considering the length and breadth of our borders and the new insight into Chinese intentions, it will be difficult to ignore the requirement of sufficient boots on the ground.",
    "Whenever economic constraints are felt, the defence forces become victims of the first surgery on funds and manpower. In national interest, we have tried to accommodate this phenomena and at times voluntarily applied cuts. Our past policy of making up shortfalls by raising and employing central police forces such as the Border Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force and the ITBP, in a military role for crisis management has many pitfalls and may not find a place in the future.",
    "In real terms it may not lead to substantial savings, considering the expenditure on equipping and maintaining them. This jointmanship also leads to command and control problems and turf wars. Prolonged employment and joint operations can affect the army culture and ethos, giving the go by to professional military orientation and imbibing some of the adverse traits associated with such employment.",
    "UNSUITABLE SELECTION POLICY",
    "Militaries all over the world are functionally required to be structured in a hierarchy rapidly narrowing upwards. Career progression towards higher ranks cannot match other organisations. In an attempt to address individual aspirations over organisational interests, we have carried out a series of upgrades and added appointments. ",
    "Over a period of time, command tenures at various levels have been reduced. It takes some time for a commander to comprehend the operational situation, establish rapport with his juniors and troops and gain their confidence. A short tenure does not allow this. ",
    "In a war-like situation, a brief tenure may not allow the commander to exploit the full potential of his command. Connected with this is the selection policy for promotion to higher ranks. A tried and tested system of the army council (all army commanders) assessing an individual for higher command appointments based on personal knowledge, spoken reputation, acceptance by peers and subordinates and evolving a consensus was replaced by a quantified point system. This system based on an anonymous merit list is most unsuitable for selecting military commanders.",
    "COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS ",
    "In the present day media and information age, news and opinions are generated in real time. In the absence of accurate situational information, comments and conclusions are generated on assumptions or sensitive information inadvertently divulged. The military needs to be oriented towards handling the information and perception domain, while senior veterans need to be restrained in their comments, especially those based on confidential information gained while in service.",
    "Some of the policies on border management are now in the public domain. Veterans should be aware that these policies have been followed for a long period. It is unfortunate that the present generation has had to bear the brunt of past miscalculations. It is now time for a review.",
    "Finally, about our soldier. Discipline precludes his speaking out but he certainly thinks and has an opinion. He continuously monitors policies that will affect his employment, emoluments, living conditions and the adequacy of his personal equipment and weapons.",
    "The young men of the Indian Army are its very backbone. Our military leadership and government must continuously nurture this valuable asset at all costs. ",

    "A study commissioned by the Union ministry of rural development on the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY), launched by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi in 2014, has said that the scheme has not made “any significant impact” and “is not achieving the desired purpose”. PM Modi had urged Members of Parliament (MPs) to adopt one or more villages in their constituency and turn them into “model villages”.  ",
    "While, in principle, SAGY is a good idea. But there are both political and structural flaws in its design. It fails to appreciate a ground reality. Any MP will find it difficult, if not impossible, to prioritise one village over another. A Lok Sabha MP represents, on an average, over 1.5 million voters of different castes, religion, gender and age groups, each with their own set of demands. For an MP to cherry-pick a few villages can be both politically counterproductive, and can disturb the delicate social equilibrium in villages/constituencies. Additionally, the scheme has no separate budgetary allocation and MPs are unwilling to allocate funds from the MP Local Area Development Scheme for projects in the model villages. ",
    "However, with the Covid-19 pandemic wrecking lives and livelihoods, and spurring an exodus of labourers from cities to villages, a new and redesigned SAGY, with funding, can work. For this, expand the ambit from one village to a cluster of villages.  Follow it up with mapping the skill sets of residents and upgrading/re-skilling them; investing in farm and related infrastructure such as cold chains and food processing units; and building critical infrastructure. This is politically more feasible for elected representatives, and can create economic opportunities within villages. "

    "Almost 2,500 years ago, Greek historian, Thucydides, wrote of the devastating Peloponnesian War, “What made war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta.” There have been other such conflicts in history between established powers and rising ones, not all of which resulted in war. The same theme is playing out today, in the tensions between the United States (US) and China, and China and India.",
    "In his provocative 2017 book, ",
    ",",
    "Harvard University professor Graham Allison was not optimistic. He wrote, “When one great power threatens to displace another, war is almost always the result”, citing 16 such conflicts in history, of which only four navigated the transition without war.",
    "Nevertheless, war is not inevitable. Among successful examples cited by Allison, the following two are instructive. First, when a century ago, the US overtook the United Kingdom (UK) as the world’s pre-eminent superpower. It took accommodation by the established power, the UK, as well as statesmanship and negotiating skills on both sides.",
    "A second approach involved a different strategy, where the established power, the US and the contender, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) were continually attempting to contain each other for decades, but did not go to war. The Cold War, in that sense, was one of the great successes of the modern era in avoiding all-out war. That was a good thing, considering that nuclear weapons were part of the equation for the first time in superpower conflicts. The US approach to the rise of China had essentially been like that first approach —the UK vs the US— for decades, but has recently been decidedly shifting towards the second strategy, that of the US vs the USSR. China’s approach towards India has always been like the latter.",
    "The US accommodation of China began with the Richard Nixon administration in the early 1970s, at the height of its rivalry with the USSR, when China was an impoverished developing nation. It stemmed from self-interest, of course, not least to counter the USSR, but also to develop a big new market for American products and a source of cheap imports. Earlier American administrations tried the same with India, but failed to crack India’s Nehruvian disdain for free markets and post-colonial suspicion of the West.",
    "There was also a belief in the West, now belied, that as China prospered, it would also become less autocratic and a more open society. While the relationship was mutually beneficial for decades, in recent years, it has soured considerably. As China became the third largest and then the second-largest economy after the US, it progressively stopped playing by the rules from which it had itself benefited, and, in fact, started flexing both economic and military muscles. Nixon himself, long after ceasing to be president, said of China, “We may have created a Frankenstein’s monster.”",
    "China’s approach towards India was always about containment. Right from the 1940s, as both emerged into a new, post-colonial, post-World War II era, it has viewed India as a long-term competitor that must be checked. Thus, its relentless focus on keeping India under pressure, and slowing down its resurgence, from every possible angle, using every possible tool at hand.",
    "China’s India-containment strategy was clear since its early patronage of Pakistan from the 1950s. It has continued to exploit that benighted nation as a client-state, primarily to act as a brake on India. Then, while establishing a detente on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India for nearly half-a-century, China began leveraging its fast-growing economy to implement the “string of pearls” strategy to encircle India from south-east Asia to Africa. This has recently seen sharp acceleration, with the Belt and Road Initiative projects such as Hambantota and Gwadar ports in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor running right through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.",
    "Most significantly, China has feverishly stepped up its attempts to cultivate Pakistan-like client states among India’s immediate neighbours, as recent developments in Nepal have shown. Furthermore, as covered in the previous edition of this column, in recent years China has also begun asserting itself globally, raising the hackles of nations near and far.",
    "India has also been changing. It had earlier wasted decades of LAC detente (when “no bullet was fired in anger, no life was lost”) by being laggardly about fortifying its border defences, unlike the Chinese. That has changed dramatically since 2014, with huge increases in infrastructure expenditure in border states, both civilian and defence. As many commentators have noted, the recent rapid scaling up of infrastructure on India’s side of the LAC was one of the key triggers for the current clash, with China wanting to intimidate India from trying to achieve parity. The Modi government has also taken similar steps abroad, for instance, by finally commissioning Chabahar port in Iran after decades of delay.",
    "This time, China has badly overplayed its hand, and been shocked by India’s determined resistance. The Modi doctrine is clearly rooted in Kautilyan principles. Unlike his predecessors, he will not be complacent with defences because of opponents’ words of peace. He will seek peace like them, but maintain it from a patient, gradually-built position of strength."

    "In my younger days, I led a couple of long-range patrols along the McMahon Line. One patrol was to go to Khang La, located on the watershed. We were late and lost a lot of daylight hours, but we pressed on to finish our task. We then strayed across the line by almost a kilometre. With no Chinese troops in sight, we divided our patrol into two teams and located Khang La only the next morning. As a young subaltern, this was my introduction to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). I later commanded the division on LAC in Arunachal Pradesh and then 14 Corps in Ladakh a few years ago. I have flown over the Galwan Valley several times. The ridge lines on the watershed are a maze with hardly any posts close to the line or any demarcation.",
    "The current boundary, LAC between India and China in eastern Ladakh, is an outcome of bloody battles fought in 1962 between the two countries in this most rugged and inhospitable of terrains. These battles were fought in October-November at Daulat Begh Oldi (DBO), Galwan, and Hot Springs, areas astride Pangong Tso lake, Razangla and Demchok. Due to severely low temperatures and high casualties, these battles came to a halt and the Chinese withdrew to their bases. Similarly, the Indian Army also moved back to nearby bases. Since then, both militaries are present there in the absence of a formal political boundary settlement. Twenty-two rounds of boundary talks have taken place between the two nations, without any worthwhile outcome. India continues to claim the entire Aksai Chin and China claims areas along a line, best described by India as the line of “Chinese perception”.",
    "The British left these boundaries un-demarcated. Its maps showed several lines, one running along the Kun-lun mountains, referred to as the Johnson-Ardagh line showing Aksai Chin as a territory within Jammu and Kashmir. Another is marked closer to the Karakoram Range described as the Macartney-MacDonald line and yet another line further west is called the Foreign Office Line. Post-Independence, these were left to the interpretation of stakeholders such as the rulers of Jammu and Kashmir, Tibet and the Indian and Chinese governments. Haphazard historical records, differing perceptions, and the machinations of cunning political leaders, left these lines to be deciphered by experts from both sides, albeit unsuccessfully. Meanwhile, the militaries of both sides have been left to hold ground that is divided by this history.",
    "While India published its map in 1954, with the international border (IB) showing Aksai Chin as Indian territory, the Chinese built the western highway through Aksai Chin in 1955 linking Tibet with Kashgarh and Xingjiang. With India’s claims as they stand, the Chinese would have considered it prudent to secure the area west of this sensitive highway. This was to be best achieved by dominating the ridge lines that run along the Karakoram Range between the watersheds of the Chip-Chap river and Galwan river, and then, moving further south-east along the ridge lines west of the Chang Chenmo Range. The Chinese concept of defending these areas is to keep the Indian forces at a stand-off distance from this highway. With the increasing ranges of artillery and surveillance resources, China seems desperate to push its claim lines further to the west. The Indian Army has a clear mandate to prevent any encroachment and alteration of LAC by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), not allowing the Chinese to unilaterally change the status of the boundary. The expression LAC was first used by Chinese Prime Minister Chou en-Lai himself in a letter to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1959.",
    "Today, the boundary in eastern Ladakh is over 800km with LAC being approximately 550km. Chinese patrols ensure they keep the passes off the watershed under domination so as not to allow the Indian troops to occupy the ground beyond. They continue to build tracks that generally emanate from the western highway and progressively move westward towards LAC to dominate the passes or crossing points. Hot Springs and Galwan are areas where both sides have been making roads and tracks. The Chinese have an advantage of terrain which is more open, plain and served by the western highway. Chinese patrols are fresh when they reach points of patrolling, often using centrally-heated vehicles.",
    "LAC has neither been surveyed nor marked on the ground. It is a line drawn with a thick pen on the map. This could translate into anything like 100 metres on the ground. A tent pitched a few metres this way or that way along this line can create trouble. However, the tents that the PLA erected along LAC was from where it can see straight into the Galwan Nala, leading to the sensitive Indian Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road and, therefore, unacceptable to India, just as the PLA is sensitive to Indian domination of the western highway. Since 1993, many agreements have been signed between the two countries to resolve such matters peacefully and according to laid-out protocols. The agreement of 1996 mentions that military means shall not be used while dealing with such border situations.",
    "In the absence of any boundary settlement, both sides have come face-to-face several times resulting in clashes, with recent ones being in 2013 at Depsang, Demckok and Chumar in eastern Ladakh. The incident at Galwan is a flashpoint of the worst kind in recent times. It can have serious ramifications when both nations have large conventional forces backed by nuclear weapons. Can the two countries afford to go to war that too when the world is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic? Why China would choose to display such belligerence at this time is open to a larger debate."

    "India should react to China’s act of aggression in eastern Ladakh through all means at its disposal — economic, military, and diplomatic. That is a given and there can be no argument about it. None. That said, India should also ensure that everything it does is driven by self-interest above all else, particularly in the economic domain. There is a clamour for cancelling contracts given to some Chinese companies across areas such as engineering and construction. So, how should New Delhi go about this? ",
    "It is easy to see why Chinese companies should be barred from all strategic areas — not just defence but also domains such as information technology and communications. There is a very opaque relationship between the private sector and the government in China and most Chinese private companies and entrepreneurs ensure their objectives are in sync with Beijing’s larger vision. In return, the Chinese government has supported these private companies, helping them grow and spread their network across the globe. In these areas, India’s answer, when it comes to participation by Chinese firms, should be a straightforward and unambiguous No. ",
    "But the line can’t be as hard when it comes to other areas. As this newspaper has reported, India depends on China for several raw materials and intermediary products (or components). Chinese companies are good at heavy engineering. India would do well to tap this expertise and continue to keep these supply chains going in its own interest. Sure, it is always good to manufacture locally, but it won’t be possible to do so overnight. Even when it does become possible, it may not make economic sense in the case of some products. Nor, for that matter, does it make sense to say no to Chinese capital, as long as investments aren’t allowed in strategic areas and there continues to be a clear line between ownership (or beneficial ownership) and management. Over the past few days, some state governments have cancelled contracts issued to Chinese companies for largely non-strategic work. This is not a good idea for two reasons. One, doing so may result in protracted and expensive arbitration. Two, more important, most of these contracts were given out to the lowest bidder. Re-tendering those contracts may cause delays that India can ill-afford as it seeks to rebuild its economy. We must get back at the Chinese, but always driven by the principle of self-interest.  "

    "Just about the time when millions of devotees were about to suffer a collective heartbreak over the grim prospect of Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath and his siblings not happening this year, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday afternoon allowed the juggernaut of the three deities to roll on the Grand Road of Puri. ",
    "Reversing its June 18 order - where the court halted the yatra citing public health and citizens’ safety amid a raging coronavirus pandemic - the apex court on Monday allowed the festival minus devotees, who have always been inseparable part of its tradition since centuries, following a change in the stand of the Odisha government. ",
    "Today’s order was as dramatic as the state government’s initial stand on not letting it happen due to the coronavirus and then doing a complete volte face in the face of public outcry. On social media, the top court’s decision is being hailed as the wish of the Lord prevailing over everyone.",
    "While hectic preparations are on to hold the Rath Yatra at Puri on June 23 without the presence of any devotees, the play of politics behind the entire event may be too glaring to miss. While the Odisha BJP unit has been uncharacteristically silent over the Rath Yatra issue, union home minister Amit Shah on Monday indicated that PM Modi nudged him to hold consultations with the Shankaracharya and the King of Puri. ",
    "“PM Narendra Modi not only understood the sentiments of devotees but also initiated consultations. Last evening, as per the instructions of the PM, I spoke to Gajapati Maharaj Ji (the king of Puri) and the respected Shankaracharya ji of Puri and sought their views on the Yatra. ",
    "“This morning, on PM’s instructions, I also spoke to the Solicitor General. It makes me, as well as crores of devotees across India happy that PM not only understood the sentiment of the devotees but also initiated consultations which ensured that the great traditions of our land are observed,” tweeted Shah in Odia.",
    "The home minister’s tweet that his government facilitated placing the matter in front of a vacation bench of the Supreme Court is an indication of the importance that the party places on Odisha. ",
    "Though the state elections in Odisha are four years away and the panchayat polls more than one and half years away, the Naveen Patnaik government’s flip-flop over Rath Yatra gave the opportunity to BJP to make some more inroads into the mind of Odia electorate. ",
    "The party over the last few years has been unsuccessfully trying to appropriate the Jagannath culture and blend it into their overall Hindutva campaign. ",
    "Puri has been central to its overall political theme. Last year, the BJP was toying with the idea of letting Modi fight from the Puri Lok Sabha constituency but later allowed its national spokesperson Sambit Patra to contest the seat. Patra lost the seat to BJD’s lawyer-turned-politician Pinaki Mishra by a whisker. ",
    "In early February, a month before Covid-19 lockdown started, home minister Shah in a political rally in Bhubaneswar spoke how Odisha is like his second home as Lord Jagannath has kept “showering his blessings on both Gujarat and Odisha.”",
    "Political analysts said the BJP first tested the waters last month when the ministry of home affairs allowed construction of the three chariots on Grand Road at a time when a strict national lockdown was in place that prohibited any construction activity.",
    "“By allowing construction of the chariots, the Centre wanted to show that it never came in the way of the Rath Yatra, the biggest festival of Odisha, even during the time of a pandemic. It ensured that the BJD would never be able to accuse it of holding up the festival,” said Gyana Ranjan Swain, political science professor of Ravenshaw University in Cuttack.",
    "Though it was expected that the Patnaik government would be able to hold the festival minus devotees, the plan began to go awry by May-end when suddenly the number of Covid-19 cases in the state saw a steep rise in numbers due to the influx of migrant workers. ",
    "From less than 15 districts by May first week, the entire state of Odisha was soon in the clutches of the pandemic by May end making things difficult for the government. The rising number of cases outside the quarantine centres too fuelled the fears of local transmission of the virus. The officials were decidedly nervous over the possibility of a full scale community transmission once lakhs of devotees thronged the temple town of Puri on the day of Rath Yatra.",
    "So when a little-known NGO went to the Supreme Court, allegedly with some backing from sections of government seeking stay on Rath Yatra due to the pandemic, the Patnaik government played along and reeled out figures of a million devotees congregating in Puri. ",
    "With SC halting the Yatra on June 18, the BJD did not account for the massive outrage among lakhs of devotees as well as the temple priests who felt shortchanged by the government. Many felt the government could have told the apex court that it can organise the Rath Yatra the way it conducted the Snana Purnima festival, an important festival preceding the car festival, in the first week of June. ",
    "The BJP’s image as a saviour of the biggest festival of Odisha may have come unexpectedly, but it nicely fits into its grand scheme of things it has for Odisha. By helping the juggernaut to roll on June 23, the party perhaps thinks its own caravan in Odisha would get a push."

    "Crisp shirt and trousers? Check. Polished shoes? Check. But instead of the distant sound of the school bus, it’s the phone that rings. Over the last three months, the nationwide lockdown imposed following the coronavirus scare has made schools take the online route to help students continue with their education. Children, as young as four years, have now gotten into the groove of interacting with their teachers and classmates via video conference – a change that arose out of necessity. And parents are concerned it’s affecting their eyesight, above all else.",
    "What helped Delhi resident Priyanka Singh was to regulate screen time of her son. “After the lockdown was imposed, children were not going out and thus, had been using mobiles to play games. Once the classes started, this added to the exposure. So, accordingly, I restricted Arav’s screen time by fixing time for both games and studies. It is certain that it will affect the eyesight. More importantly, continuous use of mobile phone will increase their dependence on it, so we need to work out a solution to minimise exposure to electronic gadgets, as it can have negative effects as well,” she shares.",
    "With increasing concerns over screen time among parents, Dr PS Narang, a Delhi-based paediatrician with around 40 years of experience, feels productivity is what should be given priority, and not screen exposure per se. “Excess of everything is bad. But a parent must understand the difference between screen exposure for playing games and exposure for social interaction, be it during online classes or with the child’s grandparents or cousins. Even when it comes to games, there are many that are informative. Those are fine, but games that promote violence should not be encouraged. These can lead to loss of sleep or even cause bad dreams. Also, getting your child into a routine is necessary. If the child is used to waking up at 7am and getting ready, it is important to maintain that, rather than waking up the child just five minutes before classes begin,” he recommends.",
    "Dr Prashaant Chaudhry, a senior ophthalmologist based in Delhi, recommends following the 20-20-20 rule for children. He also suggests casting the screen on a TV or desktop, so that a distance can be maintained, when compared to a mobile phone. “It is important to have a well-lit room as well as a good posture. Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus on something at least 20 feet away. Also, consciously you will have to blink more. Usually, we blink around 15 times in a minute, but when we stare at a screen, we blink only six times. This dries out the eyes, especially in the summer, and that causes strain on the eyes,” he says, adding that it is important to expose kids to some natural light as well. “Children should be kept engaged with board games, blocks etc, so that screen time is reduced. Also, given in the present scenario, kids cannot go out. However, they can always go to the balcony. You can encourage them to gaze at sky, birds or any other activity, so that they are exposed to some distant viewing. This negates the effect of indoor work.”",
    "It is indisputable that given a choice, parents would always prefer conventional methods of learning for their kids. However, at this point in time, safety is key. “Parents’ main concern is how can their child continue learning and not miss on the school year, whilst staying safe. Online classes are the only way a child can continue the learning process,” says Ranjini Chalam, a Delhi-based PR professional, who also feels parents must, on their part, monitor screen time beyond these classes. ",
    "Delhi-based banker Poojanjali Shukla echoes a similar view. Her daughter, 5, does miss interacting with friends. “This is a challenging time for us, but it is also stressful for our kids. My daughter attended online classes for almost one-and-a-half months. Initially, there was a break of only 10 minutes between classes, but later on, that was increased to half an hour. This way, the strain on their eyes reduced. We have to engage our kids in a constructive manner. She was able to see her friends and teachers, and she enjoyed the activities that were organised as well.”",
    "However, Meenal Sehgal is of the view that children should try and learn through natural and traditional methods as much as possible. A teacher who is conducting online classes herself and a mother of kids attending such classes, Sehgal feels schools should rely more on worksheets and hand-outs. “Children below 12 years need to be exposed to as much natural environment as possible for their education, learning and development. Exposing them to computerised learning and education often leads them to become insensitive to humanity and may instill indifference to environment. The strain on the eyes and mind is often detrimental, and leads to chances of abnormalities in sight, behavior and response mechanism. With too much virtual exposure, the child is always in an irritable mood, and complains of headaches, eye pain etc.”",

    "The city is likely to witness intermittent light to moderate rain spells over the week but intense heavy showers are not expected till the weekend, the weather bureau said.",
    "The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) district rainfall forecast for the next four days showed light to moderate rain for Tuesday followed by very light to light rain from Wednesday to Friday.",
    "“Reduction in rain intensity is due to the lack of prominent weather systems developing over Bay of Bengal that aids the monsoon current, strong wind pattern and allows the offshore trough to be active. However, none of these factors are there at the moment for the Konkan coast, especially the Mumbai region,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD director-general. “Over the next four to five days we are not expecting any intense rain activity for the Mumbai region.”",
    "So far there has been only one intense rain spell on June 18 that led to 41 mm rain in the suburbs and 44 mm in south Mumbai. After that, only sporadic showers mostly during the night or early morning have been witnessed.",
    "Between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm Monday, south Mumbai 5.2 mm rain while negligible rain was recorded in the suburbs. Over the last 24 hours (8.30 am Sunday and 8.30 am Monday), 12.5 mm was recorded in the suburbs and 0.6 mm in south Mumbai.",
    "After a lull in rain intensity, total rain recorded so far since June 1 was 7.3 mm below normal or deficient rain for the suburbs. The Santacruz weather station has so far recorded 303.4 mm rain against the normal of 310.7 mm for the period June 1 to June 22. However, south Mumbai has recorded 26.3 mm excess rain with 369.5 mm against the normal of 343.2 mm for the period.",
    "Independent meteorologists said the Mumbai Metropolitan Region would witness sultry weather throughout the week along with a partly cloudy sky. ",
    "“There will be passing light rain until June 23, following which further reduction in the rain activity will occur. Showers might increase during the weekend,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom adding that the offshore trough (weather system) had weakened. “There is a significant reduction in moisture levels over Mumbai. In addition, a break-monsoon type situation (period when intense monsoon rainfall activity shifts to the foothills of the Himalayas) is expected in India this week, which would keep rainfall in Maharashtra (including Mumbai) on the lower side,” said Deoras.",
    "The maximum temperature in the suburbs was 2 degrees Celsius above normal at 33.3 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature was 25.6 degrees Celsius, a degree Celsius below normal. South Mumbai recorded 32.8 degrees Celsius as the maximum temperature and 27.7 degrees Celsius as the minimum, both a degree Celsius above normal."

    "“Teachers will have to compulsorily attend school. If government servants are attending office, then why not teachers?” Sawant said. ",
    "The Goa government has also decided to automatically promote all students from classes IX and XI who were initially scheduled to answer supplementary examinations if they needed to be promoted to the next class. ",
    "The Central government too has not taken a decision to allow the reopening of schools across the country as cases mount. Guidelines issued under Unlock 1.0 have made it clear that the reopening of schools isn’t an allowed activity."

    "The surge in desi crime shows ha been keeping us hooked to our screens during the lockdown and almost everyone is eager to get on this bandwagon. Lalbazaar, ZEE5’s new original which takes the action to Kolkata, is one such aspirant. A better fit for a day time slot on TV , Lalbazaar has found its way online, and got attention as well with Ajay Devgn lending the trailer his voice. What it really needed, however, was an advice in the script department.",
    " ",
    "Named after the police headquarters in Kolkata, Lalbazaar rings a bell. The show is exactly what its name suggests -- a group of dedicated cops solving crimes in the Bengali heartland while a few black sheep play spoilsport. It is perhaps this predictability which unravels the show. Despite good production values, the show is letdown  by the humdrum nature of the crimes and their predictable solutions. ",
    "The show is set in Kolkata but no attempts are made to bring in the local flavour of the culturally rich city. It’s only the lead actor Kaushik Sen whose Bangla-accented Hindi gives you a sense of the place, while everyone else refuses to draw from the cultural warmth of the City of Joy. The seasoned actor that Kaushik is, he brings his experience and depth to the show and is one of its few wins.",
    "A sex-obsessed cop promises to add a quirky touch to the plot but ends up as a caricature. While the series fails to evoke any thrill or suspense, it is slightly more successful when it comes to striking an emotional chord with the viewer in terms of personal stories of the characters. ",
    "Rich in grime and violence that is an intrinsic part of the crime thrillers on OTTs, Lalbazaar fails to add meat and bones after shocking us with the bloodshed. After reeling you in with gore, which starts feeling gratuitous after a while, the show is at loose ends about what to do with you. It throws random cases at you with uneven results, but fails to bind it all together. It may satisfy the fans of CID and Crime Patrol but falls far below the current standards set up by Sacred Games, The Family Man and the more recent Paatal Lok. ",
    "Not just thematic inconsistencies, the show suffers from narrative contradictions too -- a 3-month foetus is later shown as a fully grown foetus, for instance. It is hard to accept two policemen quietly listening as irate residents berate them for spiking crime rate. ",
    "The show has a weak beginning but gathers up some steam in the second half, only to end in a giant, frothing mess of a climax. After six-and-a-half-hours of Lalbazaar, key plot points are wrapped up in a matter of few minutes as if the cast and crew had also run out of patience. The series remains open ended with the promise of a second season hanging in the air. Now that is a trip I am unwilling to make."

He made way into people’s hearts with his innumerable roles including Lord Mountbatten in the film Sardar (1993), and the titular role of Mirza Ghalib in the stage play Ghalib in Delhi. ",
    "The actor, who was battling stage four skin cancer, would have turned 70 today (June 22, 2020). Here’s a slice of what he’s left behind for generations to archive... ",
    "A sports journalist in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he is always fondly remembered to hold a special place in Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar’s life; whose first-ever TV interview was by Alter himself. Sachin had called him “a true sports lover” and said that he met “a good human being” through his first TV interview.",

    "YT: ",
    " ",
    "Born in Mussoorie, the Indian actor of American descent’s defining moment in his life came in 1970 when he cycled for more than 10 kilometers from Jagadhri to Yamunanagar through Haryana’s farms to watch Rajesh Khanna and Sharmila Tagore-starrer Aradhana (1969). Intrigued by the film industry and acting, he ended up pedalling along the same stretch five times that week to see the film again and again. Alter knew that he wanted to be like Khanna – an actor.",
    "“Watching Rajesh Khanna in Aaradhna happened to be the turning point of my life, which is how I decided to enter films. I continue to be awed by his unparalleled screen presence and persona. I came to Bombay (Mumbai) to become Rajesh Khanna. I didn’t come to act on stage. Theatre isn’t secondary, but my passion lies in films,” said the actor born and brought up in Mussoorie.",
    "Having graduated from Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) in Pune, Alter got his first break in the Dev-Anand starrer Saheb Bahadur (1977), directed by Chetan Anand. In his first release, Ramanand Sagar’s Charas (1976), he played the then superstar Dharmendra’s CID boss, and later on he worked with luminaries such as V Shantaram, Raj Kapoor, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Manmohan Desai, Manoj Kumar and Satyajit Ray as well as a host of lesser-known directors. His last film was Sargoshiyan with actors Alok Nath and Farida Jalal, which released in May, 2017. ",
    "The void was not just in films, but in the theatre circuit as well, when he left for the heavenly abode. Alter was a regular artiste on the Delhi stage and worked in various plays, some of which included Maulana based on Maulana Azad, for which he has received critical acclaim far and wide. He even portrayed the characters of Ghalib and Dr Khanna, and one for adaptation of William Dalrymple’s City of Djinns. He also received praise for his role in the film Ocean of An Old Man, which has been screened at film festivals around the world. And had directed a one-shot episode for the short-lived series Yule Love Stories in the mid-1990s. The play Lal Qile Ka Aakhri Mushaira, saw Alter portray the role of  the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar.",
    "Playwright M Sayeed Alam who worked him several times called him a “fine actor, but more than that, “a father figure and guide” to him. Always moving with the time, Alter was seen on the OTT platform, in a web series shot in Goa titled Smoke and had also written three books, one non-fiction and two fiction.",
    "Alter called Urdu his “pidri zubaan” or father tongue. “I love Urdu,” he said, adding, that “we need Urdu and Urdu doesn’t need us”. His love for the language dates back to childhood.. “My father was a padre and used to recite the Bible in Urdu. The language has no religion. I read poetry in Urdu, Hindi, English and Latin. If you love beautiful poetry, you don’t restrict yourself to one language,” he said.",
    "Before moving to Mussoorie, Bond and Alter had spent their formative years in Dehradun. “Both of us felt so much at home in India that we returned to it after living abroad.Throughout our long association, I played the role of a well-meaning older friend. He was always on the move and visited Mussoorie twice or thrice a year. He was quite sentimental about old things and our cultural heritage.When he visited me, we discussed films, books and the sweeping changes taking place in Mussoorie. He would often ask me questions about our publishing industry,” Bond, had said in an interview to Scroll, earlier."

I do not want to tell anyone how to grieve, my process this week looked pretty ugly, BUT I think one of the BEST ways to honor his legacy is to BE THE BRIGHT, BEAUTIFUL, LOVING LIGHT that he exuded each and every day. The world is a better place because of Sushant’s humble heart. Let’s keep sharing his magic and be kind to one another.”",

    "In an interview with The Times, Gemma talked about the big goof-up she made that almost ended up costing her the job. All excited after signing on, Gemma thought that a part on Game of Thrones would look wonderful on her CV. So she made the update, posted it online where the fans found it and all hell broke lose. ",
    "“The first lesson I learnt was when I first got the job. No one told me to keep quiet about it. I just thought it was normal to pop it in my Spotlight entry, so I wrote on my CV, ‘This summer, Gemma will be playing Yara Greyjoy in Game of Thrones.’ And the internet went nuts. One of the lovely, lovely producers on Thrones called me into his office and said, ‘This is very serious. We almost can’t employ you because of this’,” she said. Of course, the drastic step was never taken and Gemma played Yara all the way until the final season in 2019. ",
    "The producers were always very cautious about not letting important plot points leak into the media or online. Things became even stricter after a few episodes were leaked during the last few seasons. ",
    "Gemma talked about being a part of Game of Thrones in an interview to Radio Times. “Game of Thrones really did change things in terms of how women are written and represented. Obviously, it was a fantasy, but the women were painted very realistically nonetheless. Maybe not the murdering side of things, but they were independent and capable of running the show,” she had said. ",

CSA had conducted mass testing of over 100 employees throughout the country which included affiliate staff and some of the contracted professional players. The personnel tested also included the franchise training squads that had been assembled after the government announced that non-contact sport could resume in Level 3 of the nationwide lockdown.",

    "Over nine million people have tested positive for coronavirus so far. From the cricketing world, former Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza and former Pakistan skipper Shahid Afridi have also recently tested positive for the virus. In South Africa, Solo Nqweni, a First-Class cricketer who has been battling Guillan-Barre Syndrome since a year besides other health issues, had tested positive for the novel coronavirus last month.

    "As governments across the world eased lockdown restrictions, South Africa looked set to resume cricket with the CSA announcing the launch of an innovative competition titled ‘3TCricket’, competition, Solidarity Cup, where three teams were to play in a single match at SuperSport Park in Centurion. However, the CSA then indefinitely postponed the tournament, scheduled for a June 27 start, saying that more work is needed to stage it."

    "“There are things that we cannot control and that do not depend on us. Everybody saw what happened in Anoeta and everyone will draw their own conclusions,” Setien told reporters ahead of Tuesday’s match against Athletic Bilbao.",
    "“It’s understandable that we think why there are some actions that are reviewed, the referee himself reviews them and they don’t do the same in other plays. They do it on some matches and in some others (they don’t). So you could really think that (VAR) is not being used correctly.”",
    "Setien said controversies were part of football. “We’ve been here for many years and this doesn’t change. It’s always the same, the controversy will always be there,” he added. “VAR is a tool that can make us better, but we have to use it to have a clearer view of reality.”",
    "With 65 points each, Real top the standings due to a superior head-to-head record but Setien is convinced the title race is still in Barcelona’s hands. “Now the margin of error is smaller, but it’s also smaller for them,” he said. “Madrid cannot make any mistakes. Many leagues are decided in the end, there are eight games left. Madrid still have to play difficult games like us.”"

    "For over two decades, ever since the process of rapprochement began between India and the United States (US) after the 1998 nuclear tests, there have been two clear views within the Indian polity and strategic community. One suggested closer ties between India and the US. Advocates of this view pointed to US power; the advantages that India could extract for its economic development; the convergence in democratic values; and the fact that the US can act as an insurance policy in the face of a rising China. The other school of thought pointed to the US track record of undermining Indian interests and its close ties with the Pakistan military; and argued that proximity will undermine India’s “strategic autonomy”, and deepen New Delhi’s disputes with Beijing.",
    "All governments have chosen a middle way till now, even as they have tilted towards the first view. Recognising the benefits of closer ties with the US, New Delhi has deepened economic and military links with Washington. But it has been careful not to enter any formal alliance; been hesitant to institutionalise structures such as Quad; retained its independent positions on issues such as trade; and deepened its economic ties with China. Each time tensions with China erupted, a familiar question was asked. Is China’s behaviour a result of India-US proximity, or is India-US proximity a result of Chinese behaviour?",
    "Chinese aggression at the Line of Actual Control in the last two months, and the brutal clash on June 15 which left 20 Indian soldiers dead, have now answered the question. China will be India’s greatest strategic threat in the coming decades. Whether India desires it or not, it will end up as one of the frontline states which will have to step up to contain Chinese power, not because of a third power, but because its own interests are at stake. This will mean India has no choice but to deepen its partnerships with other countries, particularly the US. And it will reduce links with China. But even as there is greater strategic clarity, walking down this path comes with responsibility and costs. It may lead to even greater Chinese aggression, and open up the prospect of an adverse two-front situation. It will mean making difficult trade-offs, since US interests do not always converge with Indian interests. It will also mean building internal economic capabilities, ensuring social peace, and evolving a cross-party consensual position. India’s choice has been made; it now has to stay the distance."

    "As India’s border stand-off with China continues, the latter’s aggressive manoeuvres raise difficult questions about India’s diplomatic options, foreign partnerships, and future defence requirements. But the latest crisis has also set off an unseemly round of finger-pointing between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its principal national rival, the Congress, with both sides accusing the other of cosying up to the communist regime.",
    "In response to Opposition barbs that the Narendra Modi government’s China policy has been tantamount to “appeasement”, the BJP unearthed evidence that Beijing had previously funnelled money into the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, a Congress-affiliated brain trust. Caught on the back foot, the Congress took the airwaves to argue that several politically-connected Chinese firms — from Huawei to Xiaomi — have donated millions of rupees to the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM-CARES).",
    "The ugly mud-slinging between the ruling party and its primary Opposition centres on three claims: that foreign adversaries are meddling in domestic affairs; that wayward foreign “donations” are shrouded in a veil of secrecy; and that independent, third party audits are needed to clear the air.",
    "What is left unsaid is that both the BJP and the Congress have worked — often hand-in-glove — to ensure that they themselves are absolved of precisely the kind of scrutiny that they are now demanding. When it comes to transparency, credible auditing, and protections against foreign influence, both parties chant in unison: Do as I say, not as I do.",
    "In a landmark 2013 judgment, the Central Information Commission (CIC) ruled that India’s political parties operate as “public entities,” rendering them subject to the provisions of the Right to Information Act. In response, the six national parties thumbed their nose at the CIC, disregarding the apex body’s verdict. The CIC, lacking an enforcement mechanism to bring the parties to heel, referred the matter to the Supreme Court, where it languishes till today. According to an Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) analysis, two-thirds of national parties’ declared income in 2018-2019 emanated from “unknown sources”. Interestingly, the ruling party’s unknown income was 1.5 times greater that of the other five national parties combined.",
    "Of course, these figures represent what parties determine acceptable to disclose. Despite the heated rhetoric about the need for the government or Opposition interests to submit to audits by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), political parties face no third-party scrutiny. Yes, one can readily find parties’ income tax returns online. But nowhere in this raft of documents will you find either the signature of a credible, independent auditor or a tight correlation with the reality of party finances.",
    "But it is in the realm of foreign contributions where the hypocrisy of political elites is the most apparent. In 2014, the Delhi high court found both the BJP and the Congress guilty of accepting donations from several foreign corporations. In 2016, these two rivals set aside their bitter differences to bail one another out by amending the 2010 Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to retroactively redefine what a “foreign source” was under the law. Rather than face the consequences, the two parties conspired to simply reclassify previously designated foreign companies as “Indian” with the stroke of a pen. The cynicism behind this measure was matched only by the legislative clumsiness on display; because several of the foreign donations pre-dated 2010, Parliament had to pass a second retrospective bill in 2018 —this one amending the original 1976 FCRA law.",
    "Having tackled the FCRA issue, the present government ushered in a trifecta of legislative changes — the introduction of anonymous electoral bonds, the elimination of the cap on corporate giving, and the scrapping of a provision that firms detail their political contributions on their annual profit and loss statements.",
    "Collectively, these alterations have not simply opened the door to possible foreign funding, they have flung it open and laid down a welcome mat. We now know from Nitin Sethi’s investigative reporting that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Election Commission of India (ECI) both expressed grave concerns about electoral bonds. When first presented with details of the scheme, RBI told the finance ministry that the new funding instrument was vulnerable to money laundering, opacity, and potential abuse. ECI, too, lamented that the new bonds would open the door to foreign influence via dodgy money routed through shell companies. These concerns fell on deaf ears.",
    "But, perhaps, the most damning reality is that no politician in India is losing sleep over this sordid state of affairs. Politicians are counting on political tribalism to dominate common sense, sending citizens scurrying to their respective social media corners. They are counting on the populace to imbibe the headlines, glossing over the fine print. And, most importantly, they are counting on voters to ignore concerns about probity when they show up at the ballot box. And, in the end, who can blame them? As evident in voting patterns, when it comes to integrity in Indian politics, politicians have the last laugh."

    "On June 29,  the minister for electronics and information technology and law and justice, Ravi Shankar Prasad, tweeted that “For safety, security, defence, sovereignty & integrity of India and to protect data & privacy of people of India the government has banned 59 mobile apps.” After the usual partisan bluster surrounding this move subsides, India must operationalise and strengthen this momentous decision. India, its people, and its territory that are now increasingly digital, must be protected from China’s  encroachment and influence.",
    "This long-term response has to be shaped by three ideas. First, India must not contribute to the success, proliferation and performance of digital weapons that will be ranged against it. China’s tech must be recognised as one. Second, it must wean itself away from an iniquitous trade relationship that makes it dependent on a country that seeks to harm it. And, third, India needs to step out of the shadow that stunts its own economic growth, diminishes its political clout and limits its digital ambitions. ",
    "The presence of China’s hardware and platforms in India’s digital ecosystem constitutes a long-term security threat. Arriving at this conclusion requires no strenuous leap of logic. A level-headed assessment of China’s stated intentions and observable actions is enough. China has manipulated democratic means to transmit its propaganda and advertised its way to ensure suitable reportage and headlines. It has leveraged WeChat to interfere in Canadian politics, and to intercept content beyond its jurisdiction, and adopted western social media platforms to target dissidents abroad, exacerbate racial tensions in the United States (US), interfere in Taiwan’s political processes and spread disinformation about the coronavirus. China has entrenched the influence of its tech platforms in key global institutions such as the United Nations in an attempt to redraw the rules of information flows and the ethical applications of emerging technologies like facial recognition systems. ",
    "These are fundamental to China’s great power ambitions — they assist Beijing to expand its “discourse power”, develop indigenous technologies, create lock-ins through standards and infrastructure, weaponise its economic and technological interdependence, and emerge as a technology superpower. Relations with India are inconsequential to Beijing’s imagination of the world. India has to look out for itself. This new mindset to review engagement with China tech is a vital first step to protect itself. ",
    "China will continue to gather information on Indians. More worrisome is the insidious ability of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to interfere in or influence India’s political and social spheres. During the Doklam stand-off, the security establishment discovered that the Chinese-owned UC Browser was filtering certain news on Android handsets in India to shape perceptions and outcomes — classic information warfare in the digital age. Recently, we have seen content critical of China being taken down on one of the banned apps and moderation of other incidents and images as well.",
    "This is not unique to Chinese platforms. But far-reaching national security legislations, and subservience to a one man-led party that is inimical to India, make their continuance untenable. Indian democracy, howsoever flawed, must steer clear of the digital “tea rooms” owned by the CPC.",
    "Will this Indian decision cause economic harm to Chinese platforms? In terms of revenues, clearly it will not. In terms of value, tremendously so. Platforms rely on network effects to scale — every additional user drives up valuations and the aggregate data that they produce feeds into other commercial and research and development activities and product development. Indian eyeballs and data should not fuel Chinese malfeasance directed against them. ",
    "Similarly, India must bar China’s telecommunications infrastructure from its 5G networks. It is time to say “No way Huawei”. Countries such as Singapore, the US, Australia and others have already signalled different degrees of intent to manage the Dragon. New Delhi’s decision should strengthen this trend and encourage others. Political trust is increasingly going to shape the direction of technology flows. India must work with its allies and partners through new initiatives such as the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence  to compete with and contain China.",
    "India’s actions will invite consequences. China will respond using other aspects of the economic relationship. India’s dependence on electronics, pharmaceuticals and other industrial inputs are well-documented and easy pickings. China’s response could manifest itself along the Line of Actual Control or through cyber intrusions. China’s ability to impose costs must serve to motivate India.",
    "Bilateral trade is healthy when there is a balance. With China, it is a doubled-barrelled shotgun trained between India’s eyes. It is important that we fix this now as a three trillion dollar economy. Otherwise, all our future growth will only serve to strengthen the entity which seeks to weaken us. ",
    "India’s decision has come at a time when economic activity is already under siege from the Wuhan virus and when major economies are also questioning their dependence on China. A reconfiguration of value chains is inevitable. Public opinion favours this and the short-term pain will be acceptable to many. As India restarts its pandemic-stalled economy, let us create value chains that are not of dubious origin."

    "The Gauhati high court’s ruling, granting a man a divorce on the grounds that his wife refused to wear a shaka (conch shell bangle) and sindoor as per Hindu custom amounted to her refusal to accept the marriage, is a huge step backwards for women’s rights.",
    "By wearing these accoutrements of matrimony, a woman is expected to show her devotion to her husband while nothing of this sort is expected from the man. In fact, the sindoor takes on a significant role in a marriage that neither a single woman nor a widow can wear it. It is seen as a mark of respectability.",
    "In the Gauhati case, the court went further and ruled that the woman in question was guilty of cruelty under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007, as she did not want to live with her in-laws, and, hence, tried to prevent her husband from looking after his aged mother. The ruling suggests an inbuilt bias in the judiciary, particularly at the lower levels. It deprives the woman of her freedom of choice as to whether she wishes to wear symbols of marriage.",
    "This sort of misogyny is insidious as it tends to appropriate and control the woman’s wishes. The ruling – like many others in the past – deny the woman autonomy, and makes her subservient to a pre-defined patriarchal notion of what a “good” wife ought to be like. At a time when more women are entering the workforce and becoming economically independent, it seems misplaced to constrain their behaviour, whether it is within a marriage or otherwise.",
    "Unfortunately, many of India’s popular television serials and films also glorify the importance of marriage symbols such as sindoor and bangles. A marriage is a union of equals and should not be contingent on one partner being viewed as being subservient to the other. Equality under the law should be upheld in letter and spirit and the Gauhati ruling seems to go against this. ",
    "But this is not the first instance of judicial bias against women and their right to autonomy and choice. On June 22, the Karnataka high court ruling on bail in a rape case made an odd comment on the behaviour of the woman. In Rakesh B vs State of Karnataka, the judge said that the fact that victim fell asleep after the crime was unbecoming of an Indian woman, adding that this was not the way our women react when “ravished”. The allusion was that the woman had willingly had drinks with the man in question. No adverse remarks were made about the man’s conduct. Of course, this invited a furious flurry of opposition from civil rights groups and concerned individuals lamenting the deeply entrenched patriarchy at all levels of society including the judiciary.",
    "The notion that a married woman is the property of her husband or that a rape victim’s honour is besmirched, rather than the fact that her personal autonomy is violated, has guided several court rulings. The misogyny seen in the judiciary often makes it incumbent on the victim to explain her conduct. For example, why she doesn’t want to wear sindoor; why she was dressed in a particular way; or, where she was when she was assaulted. The absence of injuries on the victim, whether in domestic violence or sexual assault, is often cited as a reason to disbelieve the woman.",
    "The law does not discriminate against a woman making choices in a marriage, nor does it lay down any code of conduct for women through which they can protect themselves from sexual violence. The interpretations made by some judicial functionaries are unnecessary when the law itself is clear.",

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)  has been leveraged for this purpose. China also employs both inducements and coercion. In the Indo-Pacific region, Africa and some other regions, China has unabashedly interfered in internal matters.",
    "All emerging great powers tend to be aggressive to maximise their influence in the geopolitical arena. However, in the case of China, such behaviour seems premature. While China has made discernible strides in augmenting its comprehensive national power (CNP), there are still several internal and external challenges that continue to give President Xi Jinping sleepless nights. On the domestic front, these pertain to its economy, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)’s leadership, national morale, and the rising anti-China sentiment in the international domain.",
    "China’s shrinking economy has generated widespread unemployment. The Chinese Communist Party (CPC)-driven policy of empowering State-owned enterprises has impacted the private sector that used to contribute over 65% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and more than 90% of new jobs. Moreover, the relocation of manufacturing, growing debt, and an ageing population that will shrink its workforce, will impinge on China’s economic stability in the long-term.",
    "In 2012, Xi had announced the transformation of  PLA into a world-class military, that would facilitate its journey towards the “world’s centre-stage” by 2049. Since then, multifaceted reforms have been undertaken to enhance its combat power and accountability to the CPC. However, Xi, who personally monitors the reforms, is unhappy with the professional standards of PLA leadership as it lacks practical war-fighting experience. Several think-tanks have assessed that at this juncture, PLA is well short of the capabilities required to challenge other militaries.",
    "National morale is a crucial ingredient of CNP. China’s national morale should not be gauged by its captive media’s reportage and the diplomatic activism unleashed by its new brand of “wolf warriors”. Both are involved in countering the western and Indian media, besides marketing the Chinese model of governance and projecting Xi as a global leader. But beneath the surface, there is growing dissent against the CPC owing to the spike in unemployment, choked civil liberties and victimisation of all perceived detractors and minority communities. Xi’s heavy-handed approach in enhancing the CPC’s control is also creating dangerous undercurrents. As per open-source information, he had dismissed and imprisoned over 2.3 million officials between 2013-2018, including several senior PLA officials and bureaucrats.",
    "Given these challenges, PLA’s adventurism in eastern Ladakh appears to be ill-timed and based on flawed assumptions. Perhaps, Beijing never expected a resolute politico-military response from India. India’s military build-up and posturing, along with the measures to hurt its economy and garner international support, will give Beijing the jitters.",

While implementing a kinetic option, we must cater for the escalation, institute viable measures in the cyber domain, and also remain poised to thwart any adventurism by Pakistan.",
    "India’s long-term strategy should be guided by its national interests, based on pragmatism. To minimise risk in the face of Chinese deception, the ends, ways and means must be aligned. The ends are the objectives that we wish to achieve vis-à-vis China. The means are the political, diplomatic, economic, military and information elements of national power along with other internal and external resources available to the government. The ways are the most efficient and effective options for the application of resources to achieve the objectives. The ways selected should not get influenced by any extraneous or parochial factors.",
    "While garnering international support, India should incrementally exploit the economic pressure points against China and fast-track the initiatives to enhance its combat power and infrastructure development. A re-evaluation of the mountain strike corps to create a deterrent capability is perhaps a strategic imperative. Its application could be in the newly-created battle groups. I am flagging this issue as, during my official visit to China in July 2014, I had sensed PLA leadership’s concerns and anxiety on its raising. Today, India has the military capability to give China a bloody nose. However, the political leadership will also require large tracts of real estate across the border to enable post-conflict negotiations from a position of strength.",

    "In the nasty and cruel world of social media, even the second most powerful man in the country is not spared. When Union home minister Amit Shah was conspicuous by his absence in the first two months of the Covid-19 lockdown, there were even distressing questions raised about his health, eventually forcing the home minister to issue a clarification that all was well. In the last month, as the country slowly unlocks, all doubts have been put to rest: Shah is well and truly back. ",
    "He has given a slew of well-choreographed interviews on the first anniversary of Modi 2.0. He has addressed virtual rallies in Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal. He has closely monitored the Rajya Sabha elections, especially in his home state of Gujarat and staved off a crisis in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Manipur. Most significantly, he has virtually taken over as the Big Boss of the Covid-19-hit national capital. ",
    "In a sense, the return of Shah marks the unlocking of politics. For almost three months during the lockdown, it wasn’t just the country’s economy that was in a lockdown; it was also its politics. With the mostly-timid Opposition reduced to expressing its angst on Twitter, there seemed little space for raising issues of vital public interest. Neither Parliament nor scarcely a select or standing committee has met to address urgent matters. Yes, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has held half-a-dozen meetings over video-conference with chief ministers but these cyber-engagements cannot be a substitute for the cut-and-thrust of public debate. Where other coronavirus-affected democracies, most notably the United Kingdom, have ensured that open parliamentary debate is encouraged, India has chosen to impose a moratorium on its politics. ",
    "This willful disregard for any form of democratic dissent and discussion is dangerous. It allows a dominant party government to impose its will on the people, behind a veil of non-transparency and non-accountability. A serious national security challenge on the Sino-Indian border in Ladakh has been wrapped up in secrecy and disingenuous wordplay. The tragedy of the dislocation of millions of migrant workers is blamed on state governments. The failure to prepare for a pandemic by boosting health infrastructure is again  blamed on states. A faltering economy is put on pause mode but no industrialists (with one or two notable exceptions) can raise their voice. No details are provided to a Right to Information petition filed seeking information about the PM Cares Fund. Petrol and diesel prices are hiked 22 times in two months with no explanation. A 27-year-old Jamia Millia Islamia student activist is named as a prime conspirator in the Delhi riots but local political leaders linked to the ruling party are given a clean chit. A police officer arrested for allegedly helping terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir is granted bail because no charge-sheet is filed, but bail to human rights activists is furiously opposed. ",
    "In this ominous scenario of unbridled State power, re-enters Amit Shah. No other minister in Modi 2.0 has invested as much time and equity in keeping the political pot boiling as the home minister. From nullifying Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, pushing ahead with the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, driving the Ram Mandir agenda forward, Shah has provided the ideological muscle to the BJP’s Hindutva juggernaut. Not to forget his sharp and ruthless political instincts that have seen the BJP displace the Janata Dal-Secular-Congress government in Karnataka, engineer mass defections in Goa, topple the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, and now gradually break the Congress in Gujarat. ",
    "With Shah’s return to centre-stage, it would seem that the Modi government is preparing to shift gears once again and focus on the political management of a Covid-19-struck nation. There is, for example, an election to be won in Bihar at the year-end and Shah’s poll organisation skills will be required to ensure what seems a near-inevitable triumph. There is an even bigger prize that awaits in West Bengal next year, the conquest of which Shah has made a personal mission of sorts. That in the midst of the pandemic and in a cyclone-ravaged state, Shah chose to launch a scathing attack on his great rival, Mamata Banerjee, is a sign that the gloves are now off once again. ",
    "Ironically, the home minister is expected to work closely with state governments during a national disaster, provide support and guidance to them, and ensure harmonious Centre-state relations. Shah’s personality trait is instinctively combative but a pandemic calls for a change in style, for co-operation and not confrontation. This is not a moment for further dividing a hyper-polarised society or seeking to rule by fear and intimidation. Whether a leader like Shah can reinvent himself is uncertain. The rules for good governance are very different from those for winning elections. ",
    "Already, in Delhi, there are suggestions that Shah is overseeing the Covid-19 fight by diktat with little consultation with the state government. Which might partly explain why so many unilateral decisions taken one day are hastily abandoned the very next. The home minister may have no love lost for Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal but this is a moment to set aside personal differences and work as a team. So far, in his political career, Shah has been a divisive figure; now he needs to become a unifying force by providing a healing touch to a traumatised citizenry. ",
    "Post-script: The only thing certain about Indian politics is that the future is uncertain. At the beginning of 2020, Shah and Kejriwal were engaged in one of the most acrimonious and polarised election campaigns the country has seen. Now, a virus has forced them to jointly inaugurate Covid-19 care centres as grim-faced, masked men! "

    "While extending the provision of free ration to 800 million citizens — a move that this newspaper has welcomed — Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to the festival season, and mentioned Chhath, a key festival of Bihar. The fact that elections are due in Bihar at the end of the year, and the scheme is getting extended till the end of November, prompted many to suggest that political motivations drove the decision. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, too, said that her government will provide free ration till June, 2021. It is not a coincidence that elections are due in West Bengal next year. ",
    "In democracies, the poor and marginalised have one key leverage — the power of the vote. This forces governing elites to come up with welfare schemes to address the distress of the poor. Such schemes, be it the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in the case of the Congress or the provision of gas cylinders, housing, toilets and income transfer to farmers in the case of the Bharatiya Janata Party, have helped parties win elections. This is how it should be — you deliver to the poor, you get rewarded. But while welfare is laudable, it is essential that Indian political discourse moves to the one big challenge in current times — employment creation. The pandemic has exacerbated the crisis of employment, particularly in urban areas. It is time for political parties to compete not just on the basis of who has provided better welfare schemes, but also who has created jobs. Leaders will invest in sound economic management only when they realise that not doing so will lead to adverse electoral outcomes."

    "Scotland Yard officials on Thursday resumed investigation into the murder of an Indian-origin man in 2003, Rajesh Verma, who was attacked by individuals suspected to be of east African origin in the London borough of Ealing. ",
    "Verma, who was 42 at the time, was assaulted in Acton Park by eight men on August 31, 2003, resulting in severe brain damage. He died on May 27, 2018. A special post mortem in June 2018 concluded there was a causal link between the 2003 assault and his death.",
    "A verdict of unlawful killing was recorded at an inquest held at West London Coroners Court in November 2019. The case was classified as a murder investigation in March this year, with inquiries by homicide detectives from the Yard’s Specialist Crime Command.",
    "A £20,000 reward is being offered for any information that leads to the arrest and conviction of Verma’s killer. Officials distributed leaflets in Action high street in the borough as part of the resumed investigation, besides re-issuing appeals for information.",
    "Detective chief inspector Vicky Tunstall said on Thursday: “The attack on Raj involved ferocious violence by a group of men, one of whom, stabbed him in the head with a set of garden shears found near the crime scene”.",
    "“We believe Raj was attacked after he intervened in a dispute between one of his friends and another individual. The suspects are believed to be local to the Acton area and are likely to still be living there or have links to the area. All were described as being of East African appearance”.",
    "“This is a shocking crime and I’m in no doubt that people will have chatted and boasted about it. I need your call to identify Raj’s killer and that’s why we are offering a reward of £20,000 for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible”, she added.",
    "After the 2003 attack, Verma was treated at hospital before being discharged. However, he was left with a number of ongoing health issues due to the damage caused to his brain by the stab wound to his head.",
    "In 2015, he had a major heart attack, which resulted in a lack of oxygen to his brain that further complicated the existing damage. This rendered him unresponsive and unable to move or speak for the last 18 months of his life.",
    "Verma’s wife, Roma Verma, said the aftermath of the attack had a huge impact on the family: “Our children were 11 and 13 when their lives were turned upside down. We chose to care for him at home in the way that he had cared for all of us”."

    "In an editorial in its party mouthpiece Saamana, Sena asked that if the intelligence apparatus knew the apps posed a security risk, why were they allowed to function all these years. It also contrasted the decision to ban Chinese apps with the surgical strike in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) after terror attacks in Uri and Pulwama.",
    "On Monday, the Ministry of Home Affairs banned 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok and ShareIt. The Centre stated that it has received many complaints from various sources, including several reports, about the misuse of these apps for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorised manner to servers located outside India. It claimed the move was meant to protect the sovereignty of Indian cyberspace and ensure the interests of crores of Indian mobile users.",
    "The editorial said that merely banning apps would not impact the Chinese economy. “After there was a demand to teach China a lesson like Pakistan, India launched an ‘online’ attack or a digital strike on China and created a stir... But merely banning apps will not break the back of China. Chinese businesses have invested heavily in India. Gujarat has the majority of these investments. Chinese company Huawei has been given the contract to erect a 5G network in India. This company having the keys to India’s digital economy is like giving [China] the keys to the future economy of the country. This contract is going to be the biggest threat to India in the future. Is the government not aware of this?” the editorial mentioned.",
    "The Centre, according to the editorial, claimed that Chinese intelligence agencies and People’s Liberation Army was using app data of Indian users. “If there was a threat to national security, then why were these apps allowed to function and their businesses [allowed to] thrive all these years?” the editorial questioned. It added that there has been no change after banning these apps. “The Chinese troops are still in Galwan Valley and are refusing to withdraw.”"

    "“Sushant’s father is in a state of shock, he’s grieving obviously. He is not speaking anything and is absolutely reticent, silent. I just wanted to kind of share his grief through silence. So we just sat there for about five minutes, not saying anything or exchanging anything. His sister said that everybody has been talking about it repeatedly, that has caused more grief and harm to him. So it’s best to keep quiet,” he told The Times of India",
    " in an interview",

    "Sushant died by suicide on June 14. Even as the Mumbai Police are investigating all angles, Shekhar has been vocal in the demand for an enquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). He even started a Justice for Sushant Forum, which has been seeking a CBI probe into the actor’s death.",
    "When asked if Sushant’s family is keen on a CBI enquiry, Shekhar said, “I think it is something very personal to the family and whatever they decide, whether they want an inquiry, they don’t want is their choice. And I am not fighting on their behalf, I’m doing so as an individual. Sushant was also in public domain, he was an actor and he was part of the film fraternity and something that happened to him may happen to me or anybody else.”",

On being asked if he felt that they wanted a CBI investigation into Sushant’s death, Shekhar said, “They are grieving. They’re in a state of shock. It’s a huge tragedy and one should not interfere with their emotions at all right now. So, no, I never tried to find out.”",
    "In a series of tweets, Shekhar said that he will ‘go to the end of the world’ to get justice for Sushant and will seek support from all political parties as well. He tweeted on Thursday that he was not a ‘Twitter warrior’ and wrote, “im doing my best to take this up with the Home minister of our country to speed up the process.”",

    " has changed the demographic of the entire world. From the economy to day to day household activities, all things have been made to change to accommodate the new set of circumstances that the pandemic has brought on and the makeup industry is no exception. With masks covering most of the face, lipstick sales have taken a huge downturn and the attention is directed to the eyes. All personalisation is now dependant on eye makeup as they serve as windows to the soul even more so than usual. ",
    "In an interview with PTI, Stafford Braganza, makeup artist and trainer with L’Oréal Paris, India, said, “clear or see-through masks” will be the way to go. “Until then, the eyes are going to do most of the talking. Since the upper half of the face is the only visible part when wearing a mask, people will explore a lot more trends in the eyes and brow category, where something bold and previously unexplored is going to shine through — whether it’s a mascara heavy look, pop eyeshadows, or a dramatic wing.”",

And considering the lockdown and the free time it has afforded us, people have taken to shopping for makeup online. Despite the lockdown and social distancing, everyone still want to look presentable and well-groomed. And it is in difficult times like these that people try to bring an iota of colour into their lives, no matter how small the gesture might be. “Lipstick has seen many wars and histories, yet survived. It keeps on evolving itself to suit the needs of the current times. It will be worn, be it a zoom call, office online meetings or virtual dates. Brands will introduce new formulas in the market which will help a mask and a lipstick to coexist happily.” a spokesperson for Nykka told PTI. ",

    "Slumdog Millionaire fame actor Freida Pinto and Hollywood actor Gabrielle Union are coming together for a series based on the criticially-acclaimed book “Dressed in Dreams: ",
    "A Black Girl’s",
    " Love Letter to the Power of Fashion” by author and culture critic, Tanisha C Ford. The book was published in 2019 by St Martin’s Press to critical acclaim. In his review of the book, New York Times best-selling author of What Truth Sounds Like, Michael Eric Dyson wrote, “Tanisha Ford explores and explicates the intricacies and politics of black style with the rigor of a critic and the heart of a writer. Deconstructing everything from Afros, dashikis, bamboo earrings, baggy jeans, sneakers, and hoodies, she’s a master at letting us see and feel how what we wear expresses our politics and our deepest desires.” ",
    "The series adaptation will come in under Gabrielle’s first-look production deal at Sony Pictures Television through her company I’ll Have Another, in partnership with Pinto’s Freebird Films Entertainment.",
    "In her book, Ford uses fashion as a through-line for time and identity — afros and dashikis, go-go boots and hotpants of the ’60s, hip hop’s baggy jeans and bamboo earrings, and the ",
    "#BlackLivesMatter",
    "-inspired hoodies of today. Macmillan’s description of the book describes it as a story of “desire, access, conformity, and black innovation that explains things like the importance of knockoff culture; the role of ‘ghetto fabulous’ full-length furs and colourful leather in the 1990s; how black girls make magic out of a dollar store t-shirt, rhinestones, and airbrushed paint; and black parents’ emphasis on dressing nice.” It went on to add how the author speaks about the “pain of seeing black style appropriated by the mainstream fashion industry and fashion’s power, especially in middle America”. In this richly evocative narrative, she shares her lifelong fashion revolution—from figuring out her own personal style to discovering what makes Midwestern fashion a real thing too. These symbolic garments also represent her own life, as a Black girl coming of age in a Midwestern rust belt city.",
    "“Tanisha’s memoir brought up so much for each of us being women of colour. Fashion is such a huge part of one’s self-expression and to this day plays a major part of how we each operate in our daily lives,” Union and Pinto said in a joint statement.   The two actors, who have been friends for a long time, said they are excited to work on the series with Ford.    “For us, growing up with such unique and specifically cultural pieces of fashion helped shape our lives and we think it can be the driving force that tells the story of what it means to grow up being a proud woman of colour,” they added. ",
    "In an interview to Variety, Ford expressed her excitement, saying, “I am so excited to have my book in the hands of these incredibly talented women. Gabrielle and Freida have been such champions of my work and I am so ready for the next step in this journey of the power of fashion.”",

    "Delhi government on Thursday announced a plan to bridge the possible “digital divide” resulting from the continuation of online classes after the summer vacation in state-run schools due to restrictions imposed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic outbreak.",
    "The plan stresses on “learning with human feel” through teachers’ interaction with individual students, both with and without the facility to attend online classes. ",
    "A broad outline of the concept was announced by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who said the new programme was an attempt to minimise the loss to education and the experience of classroom learning, tough to replicate in an online learning environment.",

    " ",
    "For Coronavirus Live Updates",
    "“We are stressing on learning with human feel, as simply conducting online classes doesn’t constitute proper learning. Our attempt is to retain the human feel which generally goes missing in online classes,” Sisodia said.",
    "He added that the biggest fear with online classes related to a possible digital divide between the haves and the have nots—those with means to attend digital classes and those without it—which could lead to a learning divide, creating a social and learning gap, which will be hard to bridge. ",
    "While Delhi schools have been ordered to remain shut till July 31, the education through implementation of this scheme will from July 3 onwards, said Sisodia.",
    "The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19",
    "The new programme focuses on reaching out to students without digital facilities and also on connecting with every student on an individual level even while conducting online classes.",
    "“It is imperative for every teacher to connect with every student,” said Sisodia and added that online classes often follow a detached routine of delivering lectures to a mass of students and just playing audio video modules were taking away from the experience of learning. ",
    "“The experience of going to the school, peer learning, practical classes, visiting the library, learning together and the one to one connect with the teacher can not be substituted through digital learning,” he added elaborating on the need for the new programme that aims to address some of these issues.",
    "According to the broad outlines provided by the deputy CM. Teachers of classes between KG and standard VIII will stay connected with students and assign work on WhatsApp groups and individually interact with every individual.",
    "He added that according to the assessment done by the Delhi government, around 20% students may not have WhatsApp facility and parents of such children will be contacted by teachers for sharing teaching material and such they will also maintain a connection with the children over the phone."

Consequently, government officers belonging to other services generally come to work in Prasar Bharati on deputation.

    "Two defining moments in India’s long and harsh lockdown bring out the sharp contradictions in labour-capital relations in the economy. Every day of the lockdown brought with it images of workers, left with no incomes and social security, making their way home, hungry and tired, laying bare the realities of India’s fragile labour market. In sharp contrast to the tragedy unfolding on our highways, several state governments set about “reforming” labour laws by quite literally doing away with crucial protections in a bid to make themselves more attractive to business and revive their economies.",
    "These contradictory responses to the lockdown are a product of well-known truths about India’s labour market and unconscionable policy failure. More than 90% of India’s workforce is informally employed. About three-quarters is either self-employed or casual labourers, with no income and employment security or benefits. India’s organised sector too is characterised by stagnant wages, and a decrease in the proportion of employees with social security benefits. Juxtaposed against this is a complex and ominous legal regime for labour regulation. According to a study by Teamlease labour-capital relations are governed by 463 Acts, 32542 compliances and 3048 filings. This governance regime does relatively little to protect labour. Moreover, its complexity and associated red tape have contributed to the persistence of informality.",
    "It is this reality, and not the urgency to attract global capital, that needs to drive the debate on labour law reform. Yet, in the rush to promote ease of doing business, deregulation of labour has taken precedence over the real debate India should be having —how to rebalance regulation to enhance the bargaining power of labour without unnecessarily constraining capital. As a contribution to this rebalancing, here are some basic principles and empirical realities that a debate on genuine reform ought to consider. ",
    "First, the challenge of State capacity. Indian capital’s frustration with labour laws stems from the fact that laws are being implemented in an environment that incentivises arbitrary implementation, corruption and abuse of the coercive powers of the State. This is a consequence of a deadly cocktail of bad laws and weak regulatory capacity, particularly relating to dispute resolution and grievance redressal.",
    "Second, the imbalance in the relative economic strengths of capital and labour. India is a labour-surplus economy and labour markets are characterised by the presence of monopsony. These realities make a strong theoretical case for robust labour laws but, at the same time, risk laws being rendered ineffective by the forces of supply and demand. Therefore, labour law reform must go hand in hand with robust social security. Consider, for instance, the important role Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) played in driving rural wages upward. Greater freedom to hire and fire may make the labour market more dynamic, but in the absence of social security, they undermine labour bargaining power. Strengthening MGNREGS and Public Distribution System (PDS), and combining that with some form of social security, ought to form the backbone of a renewed reform effort.",
    "Third, the shifting global economic landscape. Against the backdrop of trade wars and retreating globalisation, it is likely that the East Asian pathway of exporting its way to prosperity in a global labour market may no longer be available for India. At the same time, the ever-expanding role of information technology will continue altering labour markets significantly. In the gig economy for instance, it is a computer that navigates relationships between labour and capital. Think of the Uber and Ola driver or the Swiggy delivery person — the workers simply do not directly engage with employers. As the global economy responds to these changes, how will international capital reorganise itself? How will local economies reshape their growth paths and what implications this will have on labour- capital relations?",
    "Fourth, the structural changes in India’s labour market post the 1991 reforms. The spatial concentration of growth has resulted in increased inter-state migration, placing new pressures on labour markets. This has been accompanied by an increase in temporary or contract workers. Contract workers now account for a third of workers in the manufacturing sector. They are dependent on intermediaries (or contractors) who are as powerful in shaping labour-capital relations as employers themselves. Meditating this dynamic is complex because contractors operate informally, a consequence of poorly designed laws. Labour law reform will need to contend with the challenge posed by the omnipresent contractor and the role he plays in shaping labour-capital relations, and yet manages to stay outside the direct purview of the law.",
    "Finally, implicit in the narrative on labour reforms is the assumption that every other aspect of the economy is working well, and fixing labour laws will unleash latent growth potential like a volcano. The reality, of course, is quite different. Other factor markets such as land and capital have a plethora of problems and putting all the reform eggs in the labour-law basket is bound to disappoint. Above all, India’s governance and labyrinthine administration pose binding constraints on the growth process. Disempowering labour through poorly conceptualised reforms will only exacerbate these challenges, not resolve them.",
    "Reforming and simplifying labour laws is the need of the hour. But doing this right requires a fresh debate. One that contends with economic realities on the one hand and revisits first principles of what makes good laws (and good economics) on the other. Above all, we need to step away from entrenched positions of growth vs labour rights, which lead to a zero-sum discourse. Protecting rights is not just a moral imperative in a democracy, but also an investment in boosting overall productivity."

    "Trump, whose approval ratings never crossed the 49% mark in the Gallup polls since he took office, is getting hammered for his handling, or the lack of it, of the two most significant crises of his presidency: The Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 128,000 Americans and infected nearly 2.8 million so far; and the anti-racism unrest that has spread deep into the country. ",
    "Trump has tended to treat the coronavirus as an interloper that stole his presidency’s most prized accomplishment and his ticket to a second term: A booming economy. And he has used the protests to further polarise the country with the sole purpose of consolidating supporters for November.",

They figured that out soon enough as Modi was among the first of world leaders to speak with the president-elect.",

    "On Friday morning, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi shaped India’s future foreign policy and security doctrine for years to come. First, by making an unscheduled, surprise visit to Ladakh at a time when the border stand-off with China, because of Chinese aggression, continues, he sent out a symbolic and political message, both within and outside the country, that India will stand up to defend its territorial integrity, in all circumstances.",
    "But, more importantly, while speaking to soldiers in the frontlines, PM Modi sent out a clear and unambiguous substantive message to China that India, and the rest of the world, will challenge its “expansionism”. By suggesting that either expansionists lose or are forced to mend their ways, the PM was telling China that the era of patience with its predatory tactics is over. By mentioning that India seeks peace — but peace comes from strength and India has done and will do what it takes to build its strength — the PM was telling China not to think that its assessment of the asymmetry of power between the two countries will make India retreat in the face of aggression. By repeatedly highlighting the bravery of soldiers and honouring them, the PM was preparing the Indian armed forces, as well as the rest of the country, for the challenges that may lie ahead. And by acknowledging Ladakh as India’s pride, the people of Ladakh as patriots, and the sites of Ladakh as having witnessed Indian bravery, he was laying an unequivocal claim to the region — all of it — as Indian territory, which is not up for negotiation.",
    "In the face of Chinese attempts to change the status quo at the Line of Actual Control, and the lack of substantive movement through negotiations at the military and diplomatic level, India had a choice. One option was to underplay the incursions, keep the issue in cold freeze, and slowly normalise the India-China relationship. The other option was to recognise the threat, decide to take on the adversary irrespective of potential costs, and reframe the entire framework of the relationship to impose costs on China. PM Modi has made his choice by picking the second option. It is now up to China to decide whether it wants to risk an escalatory spiral at the border and beyond at this juncture, or whether it is willing to restore the status quo and make peace. PM Modi has made it clear that while India hopes for the latter, it is prepared for the former."

    "The ongoing stand-off between the Indian and Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh is a fork in the road, fundamentally reshaping the direction of the bilateral relationship. Over the last few years, the architects of the gradual thaw and developing partnership between the two sides, which began in 1988, had been warning about the withering of old mechanisms that had kept the peace on the disputed boundary.",
    "Despite the pageantry of informal summitry, the strategic guidance provided by the leaders to their respective militaries has clearly not succeeded in stemming incidents. In November 2019, the minister of state for defence, Shripad Naik, told Parliament that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had transgressed into Indian territory 1,025 times between 2016 and 2018. Roughly a third of these incidents took place in 2018. In April that year, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping held the first of their two informal summits. Recent reports suggest that the number of transgressions across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) increased significantly in 2019.",
    "In fact, over the past decade or so, both India and China had seemingly settled into a routine characterised by episodes of scuffles, transgressions and incursions at different locations along the boundary. Some of these, of course, drew greater attention and were more intense than others. This had become an uneasy pattern. The loss of life in the Galwan Valley, the first in 45 years, on June 15 presents a clear break in this pattern.",
    "The current scenario, therefore, throws up a new challenge for diplomats, military personnel and political leaders on both sides. While we cannot return to the ways of the past, it is important to arrive at a new normal. Doing so, however, will first require PLA to step back and the ground situation in eastern Ladakh to return to the April status quo. This will not be easy and will not happen quickly, if at all. It will likely require more than military-level engagement, which is largely what has taken place over the past month. In the interim, it is important for India not to let its guard down militarily. ",
    "It must consider demonstrating asymmetric, low-intensity escalatory options in other sectors and theatres. Economic measures, on the other hand, need to be carefully calibrated, keeping in mind the costs to the Indian economy. Cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face will be strategic folly. ",
    "If and when de-escalation is achieved, it will need to be followed by sustained high-level engagement and significant political capital being spent. Given the differences in the governance systems of the two countries, the political cost is, of course, going to be far higher for any Indian leadership than for China’s leaders. The fact that conflict doesn’t serve either side’s strategic interests is likely to encourage the two leaderships to consider bearing the cost of engagement. Does that mean that we should rule out the possibility of conflict? No, it doesn’t. But it does mean that both sides will incur extremely heavy costs in case of conflict. ",
    "For all its bluster, a conflict will seriously retard Beijing’s march towards its centenary goals. At the same time, even with significant political engagement, the structural fault lines between India and China imply that a new normal will not be any less volatile. This will complicate political decision-making going forward.",
    "There are tactical and strategic factors driving the current stand-off, which derive from these structural fault lines. While there is a significant power asymmetry between India and China, both are experiencing a simultaneous rise. Both sides have greater capacity today than at any point since the formation of the modern Republic of India and the People’s Republic of China. This translates, for instance, into enhanced infrastructure development on the boundary, which can spark insecurity in itself. ",
    "At the same time, both sides also have coinciding and expanding circles of interests, which lead to new sources of friction. This has been evident in the jostling for influence and crossing of old redlines in the broader Indian subcontinent. ",
    "Now place all this in the context of the geopolitical flux that prevails in the world — a flux characterised by not just China-United States (US) competition but also socio-political chaos in the US, the unpredictability in its foreign policy, and ambivalence with regard to alliance partners and global institutions. In such an environment, one can only expect increased volatility between India and China."

    "While extending the provision of free ration to 800 million citizens — a move that this newspaper has welcomed — Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to the festival season, and mentioned Chhath, a key festival of Bihar. The fact that elections are due in Bihar at the end of the year, and the scheme is getting extended till the end of November, prompted many to suggest that political motivations drove the decision. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, too, said that her government will provide free ration till June, 2021. It is not a coincidence that elections are due in West Bengal next year. ",
    "In democracies, the poor and marginalised have one key leverage — the power of the vote. This forces governing elites to come up with welfare schemes to address the distress of the poor. Such schemes, be it the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in the case of the Congress or the provision of gas cylinders, housing, toilets and income transfer to farmers in the case of the Bharatiya Janata Party, have helped parties win elections. This is how it should be — you deliver to the poor, you get rewarded. But while welfare is laudable, it is essential that Indian political discourse moves to the one big challenge in current times — employment creation. The pandemic has exacerbated the crisis of employment, particularly in urban areas. It is time for political parties to compete not just on the basis of who has provided better welfare schemes, but also who has created jobs. Leaders will invest in sound economic management only when they realise that not doing so will lead to adverse electoral outcomes."

    "For over two decades, ever since the process of rapprochement began between India and the United States (US) after the 1998 nuclear tests, there have been two clear views within the Indian polity and strategic community. One suggested closer ties between India and the US. Advocates of this view pointed to US power; the advantages that India could extract for its economic development; the convergence in democratic values; and the fact that the US can act as an insurance policy in the face of a rising China. The other school of thought pointed to the US track record of undermining Indian interests and its close ties with the Pakistan military; and argued that proximity will undermine India’s “strategic autonomy”, and deepen New Delhi’s disputes with Beijing.",
    "All governments have chosen a middle way till now, even as they have tilted towards the first view. Recognising the benefits of closer ties with the US, New Delhi has deepened economic and military links with Washington. But it has been careful not to enter any formal alliance; been hesitant to institutionalise structures such as Quad; retained its independent positions on issues such as trade; and deepened its economic ties with China. Each time tensions with China erupted, a familiar question was asked. Is China’s behaviour a result of India-US proximity, or is India-US proximity a result of Chinese behaviour?",
    "Chinese aggression at the Line of Actual Control in the last two months, and the brutal clash on June 15 which left 20 Indian soldiers dead, have now answered the question. China will be India’s greatest strategic threat in the coming decades. Whether India desires it or not, it will end up as one of the frontline states which will have to step up to contain Chinese power, not because of a third power, but because its own interests are at stake. This will mean India has no choice but to deepen its partnerships with other countries, particularly the US. And it will reduce links with China. But even as there is greater strategic clarity, walking down this path comes with responsibility and costs. It may lead to even greater Chinese aggression, and open up the prospect of an adverse two-front situation. It will mean making difficult trade-offs, since US interests do not always converge with Indian interests. It will also mean building internal economic capabilities, ensuring social peace, and evolving a cross-party consensual position. India’s choice has been made; it now has to stay the distance."

As per Unesco’s estimates, over 280 million children in India have been impacted by school closures due to Covid-19. ",
    "The government has succeeded in getting children into school with nearly 100% enrolment, but one-fourth drop out after class 8, and over half after the class 10. The drop-out rates for girls and those from the marginalised sections are higher. The learning outcomes, whether measured by the National Achievement Survey 2017 or the Annual Status of Education Report 2019, haven’t shown much improvement. ",
    "Even lower middle class parents have been taking their children out of government schools and putting them in low-cost private schools. Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas aside, government school systems suffer from poor information technology (IT) infrastructure and IT-trained teachers. ",

    "(SEQI) Report 2019",
    " by NITI Aayog indicates that in states such as Kerala too, half the elementary schools do not have computer-aided learning, and even in the best-performing states such as Tamil Nadu, one-third of secondary schools do not have computer labs. The survey includes private schools, too.",
    "The usual explanation of poor students in cities and rural areas not having computers/smart mobile devices and high-speed broadband has often been cited for the inability of government schools to get on to the blended online learning bandwagon. ",
    "However, every third person now has a smartphone, and rural India has 227 million active Internet users — a clear lead of 10% over urban India. Over the years, there has also been a push by the government towards technology-enabled learning; self-learning online portals such as Swayam, e-Pathshala and Diksha have come up and school books are available online. ",
    "Doordarshan",
    ", too, has started special education broadcasts, which are also available on YouTube. Government school teachers use WhatsApp to send small videos and exercise sheets. ",
    "The effectiveness of these interventions in enhancing learning outcomes, though, remains uncertain. Research says that the academic content delivered through a passive one-way communication does not engage a student’s curious mind. On the other hand, active learning can lead to improved cognitive outcomes. ",
    "Additional factors such as unavailability of separate rooms for children as well as noisy surroundings in homes have been mentioned. ",
    "But given these extraordinary times, where physical presence is not possible, the blended online delivery of school lectures by teachers remains the most effective way. Results from J-PAL’s Educational Technology Evidence Review",
    "from 126 studies on the role of technology in education indicate that blended learning, ie. combining online and in-person instruction can deliver as good an outcome as in-person class experience. This, however, requires teachers to be trained in technology-enabled active learning pedagogy. ",
    "The State could even have a component for tech-enabled learning as part of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan for IT infrastructure, devices, teaching-learning material, teacher training and engaging quality teachers in the district. If what gets measured gets done, the NITI Aayog and ministry of human resource development will have to increase weightage for computer-aided learning and computer labs in SEQI, which allocates 10 out of nearly 1,000 grade points. Given that technology tools often make it possible to collect data on how something is working, the National University of Educational Planning and Administration could be asked to undertake evaluations, which help policymakers and administrators make better decisions regarding investment in education technology solutions. ",
    "In India, where the availability of quality teachers, away from capitals/district headquarters and especially in subjects such as math and sciences, remains a challenge, blended online learning has a distinctive advantage of removing the physical barrier between places where teachers are available and where they are needed. ",
    "It can also help take education to girls, to those from marginalised sections and those in remote areas. It may not solve the problems of the school education system, which requires incentives for schools and teachers, autonomy to principals, well-functioning school management committees, teacher accountability, and management systems including transparent transfer policies. However, it could address India’s most persistent challenge of ensuring quality education in government schools and take us closer to Sustainable Development Goal 4 of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education.

    "History-sheeter Vikas Dubey, 48, who along with his shooters killed eight cops during an ambush in Bikru village in Kanpur Dehat early on Friday never allowed the police to raid his village where he lives in a sprawling house surrounded by his supporters.",
    "Whenever the police attempted a raid, it faced stiff resistance and had to beat a hasty retreat from the village.",
    "This is not the first time Vikas Dubey has taken the police head-on.",
    "In the past two decades, there have been four major encounters when the police were fired upon indiscriminately or were taken captive and released after the interventions of Dubey’s political bosses who always walked an extra mile to save him, said those who know him and his working.",
    "In 2005, in a similar incident, Dubey and his men surrounded a raiding circle officer Kalyanpur, Abdul Samad, fired at his team and then held him captive. It was Dubey’s mother who convinced him to release the men as she feared the cops would avenge this humiliation.",
    "Such was his political clout that the complaint of the circle officer was not registered at Shivli police station. Not only this, Vikas Dubey slapped the visiting DIG (prisons) in Kanpur jail after the officer rebuked his boss Ranga Yadav and him in 2000 when he was arrested for murder of a principal Siddheshwar Pandey, recalled a police officer who pursued him. Then he had the entire Kalyanpur police station gheraoed when by chance sub inspector Hari Om Sharma arrested him.",
    "Not only the people, two MLAs sat on a dharna outside, seeking his release.",
    "With nearly three decades of criminal history Dubey, 48, harboured criminals on the run in his fortress established in Bikru village, patronised young shooters and provided them illegal firearms, said police officials aware of his past history.",
    "The officials said Dubey used this force of criminals to grab land, influence local elections and extort money from property dealers and businessmen as well as eliminate his rivals. Dubey remained associated with several politicians of the region, they added.",
    "A senior police official at DGP headquarters said although Dubey had remained involved in crime since teenage, the crime record available with the police had as many as 60 criminal cases against him since 1993. “His crime record reads that he had over 11 cases of attempt to murder and six cases of murder but he had remain involved in over 20 murders directly or indirectly and harboured shooters involved in different murders in the region,” he said.",
    "The official said Dubey’s house in Bikru, termed as his fortress, had a campus of over 10,000 square ft. The house was designed in such a manner that one could easily keep watch for up to 500 metres from the rooftop, he said. Moreover, he had informers in the entire village.",
    "The official said, “His bravado can be gauged from the murder of politician Santosh Shukla, who had a post equivalent to minister of state, in 2001. Dubey chased Shukla and shot him inside Shivli police station when the latter tried to hide there.”",
    "Later, Dubey was acquitted in the case after all witnesses, including police personnel, turned hostile, he said.",
    "When Vikas Dubey was a student of class nine in Rasoolabad Inter College he carried a country-made-pistol in his school bag, recalls a classmate living in Kanpur Dehat. He was asked to leave the school.",
    "In 2006, he was arrested in Saharanpur on charges of possessing drugs."

That order was more symbolic. The four have already been designated as terrorists by the United Nations Security Council; Hafiz Saeed as far back as in 2008.",

    "has been engineered and backed by Pakistans’ ISI",
    " that has been working for years to revive terrorism in Punjab.",
    "Here is why the government has designated them as terrorists.",
    "GURMEET SINGH",
    "Based in Hamburg, Germany",
    "Gurmeet Singh aka Bagga, 50, is a close associate of Pakistan-based Sikh radical Ranjeet Singh alias Neeta. Bagga is a former Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) terrorist and is wanted in three cases of shipment of a huge quantity of explosives from Pakistan to Punjab to carry out terror strikes. He has lately been instrumental in smuggling weapons from Pakistan, often using Chinese-made drones that carry a payload of firearms weighing around 10 kg across the fenced border into border villages of Punjab. Bagga was also sentenced to a 4-year prison term by a German court for assassination attempt on Radha Swami Beas Chief, Baba Gurinder Singh Dhillon in Vienna.",
    "RANJEET SINGH",
    "Based in Lahore, Pakistan",
    "Ranjeet Singh alias Neeta is the chief of Khalistan Zindabad Force. According to the Union home ministry, he is involved in numerous cases of murder, smuggling of arms and fake currency.

According to his dossier, he has been the mastermind and key conspirator of many terrorist acts including bomb blasts in India. Besides, he has been accused of promoting terrorist activities in India by talent spotting and arranging training of recruits.",
    "Nijjar became the operational head of Khalistan Tiger Force after the arrest of its chief Jagtar Singh Tara in 2015. Tara , an accused in the ex-chief minister Beant Singh assasination case, had broken out of a Chandigarh jail in 2004, moved to Pakistan, before landing in Thailand’s Bangkok where he was arrested and brought back.",

According to police records, Wadhwa Singh was part of the six-member Babbar Khalsa team that shot inspector Pritam Singh Bajwa and a constable who raided their hideout in Ludhiana’s Daheru village. The terror group had later gone on to blow up an Air India plane on its way to Montreal, Canada from Delhi, that killed 329 people, mostly Canadians.",

Pannun has been leading a campaign “Punjab Referendum 2020 for Khalistan”, launched in a rally in June 2014 in New York. NIA DIG Sonia Narang told a UAPA tribunal last year that the SJF is presently propagating ‘Referendum 2020’ in a very big way on the social media as well as on ground by holding meetings across USA and other countries where Sikhs are in large numbers. Activities of the SFJ have been held to be unlawful, disruptive and threaten the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of India by the tribunal that confirmed the ban under India’s anti-terror law. The judge said there was enough evidence that SFJ works in collusion with anti-India entities and forces."

    "On the second day of the riots in North East Delhi on February 25, a group of men created a WhatsApp group — Kattar Hindut Ekta — and asked all Hindu residents to attack Muslims, according to Delhi Police’s charge sheet filed in a city court on Tuesday. ",
    "Police said the charge sheet is related to FIR No 102/20 registered at the Gokalpuri police station in connection with the murder of Hamza, who is referred to by a single name in the police records, who was among the nine Muslim men whose bodies were recovered from the Bhagirathi Vihar drain on February 25 and 26. Police arrested nine men, Lokesh Solanki, Pankaj Sharma, Sumit Chaudhary, Ankit Chaudhary, Prince, Jatin Sharma, Rishab Chaudhary, Vivek Panchal, and Himanshu Thakur. The nine are currently in jail. ",
    "Police said that the administrator of the WhatsApp group -- initially there were 125 members -- brought together other rioters. The charge sheet also mentions that on February 26, at 11.39 pm, Solanki posted a message where he claimed that he and his “team” could come from “Ganga Vihar” and that they had “arms and ammunition.” Ganga Vihar adjoins Bagirathi Vihar. ",
    "According to the charge sheet, Solanki’s second message at 11.44 pm claims that he and his team have killed “two Muslims” and thrown their bodies in the drain. ",
    "The court is yet to take cognisance of the charge sheet and the arrested persons are yet to reply through the lawyer. The counsels for the accused persons will appear before the court and make the submission after the court takes cognisance.",
    "The charge sheet adds that the group murdered nine Muslims in all. The charge sheet also mentions how the men assaulted the Muslim residents.",
    "“Their modus operandi was that they used to catch the people and ascertain their religion by asking name, address and identity card. They were forcing them to call out “Jai Shri Ram’ many times.” Those with a Muslim name in the ID card, and who refused to chant the slogan were “ bluntly attacked and thrown into the Bhagirathi Vihar drain,” the charge sheet says. ",
    "Delhi Police has filed at least 111 charge sheets thus far in connection with the riots, in which they have named 650 people. ",
    "At least 53 persons died while around 400 were injured in the riots that broke out in parts of North East Delhi. Police in the charge sheets have alleged that the riots were planned by student activists, locals politicians, and some activists of the anti Citizenship Amendment Protests. Student leaders from Jamia Millia Islamia and JNU have been arrested in connection with the riots."

    "Ganguly captained India in 146 ODIs, out of which India won 76, lost 65 and 5 were no results. In Test cricket, Ganguly had an even better record as a captain. In his 49 Tests as captain, Ganguly led India to victory on 21 occasions, losing 13 while 15 ended up as a draw.",
    "Ganguly hanged his boot in 2008 after playing 113 Tests, 311 ODIs, scoring 7212 and 11363 runs respectively. Ganguly also had 23 ODI hundreds to his name which is the fourth most by an Indian after Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, and Rohit Sharma. "

    "Not just confusion and chaos, the fear in the air was too apparent, she admits. “There were very few people, and to enter the airport itself, our temperatures were checked, we had to have the safe status on the Aarogya Setu app. There was social distancing everywhere, our IDs were checked from a distance, there were hand sanitisers everywhere. There was no taxi service available when we landed in Delhi. The sentiments were low, and it was depressing. The airport is always full of enthusiasm, but there wasn’t any. It should be better now, however,” she tells us. ",

    "If you are having trouble sleeping after heart bypass surgery, morning walks are the solution, according to recent ",
    "research",
    ". ",
    "The research was presented on ACNAP Essentials 4 You, a scientific platform of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).",
    "“Many patients have trouble sleeping after heart bypass surgery,” said study author Dr. Hady Atef of Cairo University, Egypt. “When this persists beyond six months it exacerbates the heart condition and puts patients at risk of having to repeat the surgery. It is therefore of utmost importance to find ways to improve sleep after bypass surgery.”",
    "Previous studies examining the effect of exercise on sleep after heart bypass surgery have failed to simultaneously assess the impact on functional capacity (the ability to do usual activities), which often declines after surgery.",
    "This study investigated the effect of exercise on both sleep and functional capacity. The study enrolled 80 patients aged 45 to 65 years who had sleep disorders six weeks after heart bypass surgery and also had reduced functional capacity.",
    "Three baseline measurements were performed. First, a six-minute walk test, which measures the distance patients are able to walk in six minutes on a hard, flat surface, and is a validated way to assess functional capacity. Second, participants completed the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) questionnaire which asks about sleep disorders. Third, patients wore an actigraph watch for 96 hours to monitor rest and activity. Many of these patients have trouble staying awake during the day but have insomnia at night - the actigraph picks up both problems.",
    "Patients were then randomly allocated to two exercise groups: aerobic exercise or a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise. Both groups did 30 exercise sessions in the morning over a 10-week period. During the aerobic exercise sessions, participants walked on a treadmill for 30 to 45 minutes. During the aerobic and resistance exercise sessions, participants walked on a treadmill for 30 to 45 minutes and did circuit weight training (a form of light resistance exercise).",
    "After 10 weeks, patients completed the three assessments again: the six-minute walk test, the PSQI questionnaire, and wearing the actigraph watch for 96 hours. Changes in sleep and functional capacity were compared between the two exercise groups.",
    "The researchers found that both exercise programmes (aerobic exercise alone and combined aerobic/resistance exercise) improved sleep and functional capacity over the 10-week period. But isolated aerobic exercise was much more beneficial on sleep and function than the combined programme.",
    "Prior studies on sleep have used the PSQI questionnaire or an actigraph. A strength of this study was to use both methods of assessment, thereby providing a complete picture of the sleep disturbance. Together these measurements showed that exercise helped patients fall asleep, sleep continuously rather than waking up in the night, and sleep longer and more deeply.",
    "“Our recommendation for heart bypass patients with difficulty sleeping and performing their usual activities is to do aerobic exercise only,” said Dr. Atef. “We think that resistance exercise requires a high level of exertion for these patients. This may induce the release of stress hormones which negatively affect sleep.”",
    "“Aerobic exercise means physical activity that does not require a very high level of exertion,” he explained. “Choose an activity you enjoy like walking, cycling, or swimming. Aim for 30 to 45 minutes and do it in the morning because research shows this releases the hormone melatonin which helps us sleep well at night.” ",

    "56 year-old Kravtiz, said in an Instagram video, “Good morning, I hope you all are well. I just want to let you know that I’ve written a memoir, called Let Love Rule. The book is about the first 25 years of my life, culminating in the release of my first album. Those years shaped me and taught me so much about myself and also formed a message of love and unity that I still believe in till this day.”",
    "The Grammy winner, known for songs including “Again”, “Fly Away”, “American Woman”,  went on, “It’s a message I stand for and will live by with forever... I’m looking forward to sharing my journey with you. And I hope you enjoy it...”",
    "In a statement, Kravitz said, “Writing this memoir has been a beautiful and interesting experience taking me through the first 25 years of my life, from birth to release of my first album. That journey, full of adventure, was where I found myself and my voice. Through that experience, love was the force that paved the way and love became my message.”",
    "The memoir will span Kravitz’s childhood, as he navigated between Manhattan’s Upper East Side and the Bed-Stuy neighbourhood of Brooklyn, as well as young adulthood journeys in Los Angeles, France, England and Germany.    With Kravitz as the focal point, “Let Love Rule” will also feature accounts about the singer-songwriter’s father, Sy, a news producer; mother Roxie Roker, a TV actor; and actor Lisa Bonet, his muse and former wife. Kravitz will also narrate the audiobook version of his memoir.",

    "lifestyles",
    " and most professionals working from home, breakfast becomes that one meal that you just can’t afford to miss! So, having a good and filling breakfast is of paramount importance.  We suggest you these five quick and easy breakfast options. Take your pick: ",
    "1. Avocado on toast",
    "There’s nothing like a good ol’ avocado on crusty whole wheat toast, right? You can mash or slice it as per your taste. Scoop out the goodness of the pulp, and top it up with garlic, onion, tomato, add leafy herbs, drizzle balsamic vinegar. Or just go simple with red pepper flakes, lemon, salt and black pepper, and drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil on the top. ",
    "2. Vermicelli Upma",
    "Wheat or semolina vermicelli is super quick to make. There’s no recipe simpler then making this one when trying your hands in the kitchen. It’s also one breakfast option that has many variations. Boil it and toss it with chopped onions, ginger, and add lots of veggies like carrots, beans and peas and voilà, it’s ready! Alternatively you could also heat oil, add urad dal, mustard and cumin seeds, chillies and curry leaves. Sauté these with onions and tomato purée, veggies, a little bit of water and bring it to a boil. Add turmeric powder and salt. Allow all ingredients to cook for five to six minutes.Then add vermicelli and mix well. ",
    "3. Masala Omelette",
    "Most of us have a soft corner for eggs. So, masala omelette becomes one of the choicest dishes to prepare, and also the one that can be tried with all possible variations. You could add onions, tomatoes, green chillies, coriander, mushrooms, cheese or even chicken to make it more filling. Have fun with a variety of toppings such as capsicum and boiled potatoes. Make a smiling face with tomato ketchup, and serve!  ",
    "4. Porridge",
    "You can’t go wrong with porridge! A quick instant brekkie option, all it needs is a little bit of focus. Mix oats, milk, and water in a bowl, and add a pinch of salt and microwave it for about five  minutes. Top it up with fruits of your choice, and then you can completely skip adding sugar. Add honey only when the porridge turns lukewarm or after it cools down. ",
    "5. Chickpea Salad",
    "This breakfast option will keep you kicked till evening! So on days when you have long conference meetings planned over phone or web, all you have to do is right in the morning, boil chickpeas and soak some soya granules. Later, add peanuts, onion, tomato, salt and pepper, and sprinkle some chaat masala and lime juice. Give it a good toss and it’s ready.",

    "The rural development department (RDD) planned to distribute the homeopathic compound Arsenicum Album 30 to 1.5 crore households in rural areas by procuring the drug at state level, but high prices quoted by bidders has derailed the plan. The bidders quoted almost three times what the government had expected. RDD has now asked district administrations to procure Arsenicum Album 30 at their level and distribute it.",
    "In June, RDD had planned to distribute Arsenicum Album 30 in rural areas and expected each bottle to be priced between Rs 8 and Rs18. RDD minister Hasan Mushrif said this decision followed the ministry for Ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homeopathy (Ayush) recommending the drug as a prophylactic. To this end, RDD had decided to use Rs 25 crore accumulated from unutilised grants given by 13th and 14th finance commissions over the last 10 years for development of rural areas. ",
    "However, the two qualified bidders quoted Rs 23.92 and Rs 23.74 for a bottle of 100 pills. “The rates were higher than expectation as it involved packing and transportation of the drug across the state,” said an RDD officer on condition of anonymity.",
    "When RDD learnt some local bodies, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), had procured the stock at much lower prices, it decided to scrap the bidding process. ",
    "“The bidding process started around three weeks ago and there was high fluctuation in price of the pills when it was underway. Instead of going into more negotiations, we decided to ask the district administration to procure and distribute,” said Arvind Kumar, principal secretary, RDD. "

The state also submitted that it was following the guidelines issued by the Centre over the disposal and management of bodies of Covid-19 patients. ",
    "However, senior counsel Rajendra Pai, along with advocates Akshay Pai and Omkar Khanvilkar, who appeared for Shelar, submitted that as the bench widened the scope of the petition in light of the instances similar to that of Sion Hospital, they wanted to submit the same in the form of an affidavit and hence the hearing of the PIL should be deferred.",
    "After hearing the submissions, the court directed Shelar to submit videos and information of other instances in an affidavit and also directed the state to file a rejoinder, if any, before the next hearing.",
    "In the earlier hearing, the state and BMC submitted the report of the committee that was constituted to probe into the video of the Sion hospital incident. Shelar’s counsel then sought a probe by the committee into the other instances of the alleged mismanagement too that were mentioned in the PIL."

    "In a bid to scale up testing and measure the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in Delhi, government and private hospitals in the capital have begun testing for Covid-19 using the antigen-based method  following the state government’s nod. ",
    "Samples, however, will not be collected from homes for the antigen test as they need to be processed within an hour of collection. An antigen is a foreign molecule that induces an immune response in the body, especially the production of antibodies, and detecting its presence determines a present infection.",
    "“We started the antigen testing from Wednesday. The selection criterion depends on how quickly the results are needed as it is quicker than the RT-PCR test. If there’s time in hand, then we prefer testing through RT-PCR because if an antigen test is negative, one has to repeat the test through an RT-PCR,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.",
    "The Indian Council of Medical Research has validated the point-of-care antigen method for Covid-19 diagnosis, which can be used in containment zones, hot spots and hospitals. The test can give results in maximum 30 minutes compared to five hours in the conventional real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.",
    "The Delhi government also started rapid antigen-based testing on June 18. So far, the exercise was confined to containment zones but on Friday it was expanded to other areas across all 11 revenue districts. Till Thursday, around 150,000 people were tested through antigen kits. The positivity rate is around 7.5%, said a senior government official.",
    "No testing numbers were readily available for the hospitals.",
    "Apart from Apollo, other corporate hospitals such as Max Healthcare and Ganga Ram Hospital have begun antigen tests. “This is a naso-pharangial swab test like in RT-PCR that detects current infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. This is quick and a lot cheaper. But we carry out an RT-PCR gold standard test for confirmation in case the result is negative,” said Dr Poonam Das, chief of pathology, Max Labs.",
    "The antigen test has high specificity (true negative rate) of 99.3% to 100%, which rules out people who are not infected. Tests with high specificity are most useful when the result is positive. Sensitivity (true positive rate) is lower at 50.6% to 84%, which makes it less accurate in correctly diagnosing a positive case. This is why people who test negative, especially those with symptoms, have to undergo an RT-PCR test to rule out active infection.",
    "The deadline for sample processing makes the test more feasible as a hospital-based testing modality. Private stand alone laboratories are, however, still contemplating on whether to start, and how to start, antigen testing.",
    "“Even though the government has allowed antigen testing, we haven’t started it as we are figuring out the modalities. For hospitals, it is more feasible because you are collecting samples on the spot and can send for processing almost immediately. If at all we decide to do antigen testing, then it has to be through our drive-thru facilities and not home collection,” said Sanjeev Vashishta, managing director and CEO, Pathkind Diagnostics.",
    "A representative of another private laboratory, agrees, “When I send a person for home collection, they collect a few samples together. In case of antigen tests, the sample has to be processed within an hour and I can’t be sure if my phlebotomist is back in time. After an hour, the sample will go bad, which is why it is called a point-of-care test.”",
    "Availability of kits is another problem for labs as only one company’s kits have been validated so far.",
    "The kit— Standard Q COVID-19 Ag detection kit—has been developed by SD Biosensor, a South Korea-based company, and jointly validated by ICMR and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has also approved its import and manufacturing in the country.",
    "“We can produce almost two lakh testing kits in a day,” said CS Bedi, medical advisor, SD Biosensor.",
    "Labs say placing a bulk order is a problem as only one company is supplying all kits and demand is huge. “Even though we are getting the orders we placed, still I would say these kits are in short supply,” said a hospital source from Fortis Health care. Fortis is in the processes of procuring kits and will start antigen testing soon.",
    "Government hospitals are also beginning to conduct the test. “We have started antigen testing for Covid-19 in our hospital last week,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. ",
    "The eligibility for performing antigen testing is the same as that for RT-PCR test. The most important requirement is a valid prescription from a registered doctor, an ICMR form that your doctor will fill in and a government identity proof. The test result can be collected the same day.",
    "“We follow ICMR guidelines for testing. For antigen based-testing, it is the same,” said an official at Ganga Ram Hospital, who did not wish to be identified.",
    "Most hospitals are accepting walk-ins for tests if there is a valid prescription. Those without a prescription will be directed to the hospital’s fever or flu clinic where a doctor will assess the person and prescribe a test, if required. ",
    "The antigen test cost is around ₹1,000 for a test compared to Rs 2,400 for the RT-PCR  test.",
    "ICMR has advised states to use the antigen kit for Covid-19 diagnosis in containment zones, hot spots, and hospitals to test all symptomatic influenza-like illness, asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts with co-morbidities, and asymptomatic high-risk patients who are hospitalised or seeking hospitalisation. ",
    "High-risk patients include those undergoing chemotherapy, immunosuppressed patients, including HIV positives, suffering from a malignancy, transplant patients and elder patients with co-morbidities.",
    "The test has also been allowed in asymptomatic patients undergoing aerosol generating surgical or non-surgical interventions such as neurosurgery, ear nose throat surgery, dental procedures, bronchoscopy, upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy and dialysis.",
    "“It is a slightly crude test when compared with RT-PCR. The RT-PCR detects the RNA of the virus. Antigen tests what you call is the wall of the virus, but what works in its favour is that it is quicker and does not require too much technical expertise for performing the test. It’s a good alternative,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, AIIMS, Delhi."

    "The Union finance minister-led GST Council is an apex federal body that decides all matters related to the indirect tax. State finance ministers are the council’s members and its decisions have conventionally been unanimous.",
    "Experts, businesses, and some council members have said GST appeared to be complicated for the taxpayers even three years after it was introduced. ",
    "West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra on Wednesday told CNBC TV18 that it was difficult for a common businessman to comply with GST as about 140 circulars and 165 forms related to it have been issued in three years. He added in effect they have 24 returns to fill. Mitra’s comments coincided with GST’s third anniversary.",
    "A second person cited above said the indirect tax reform was massive that brought uniform structure after merging a plethora of local levies. “In itself, it is the ease of compliance for taxpayers. Yes, it is a dynamic system that is constantly improving. Therefore, [there is a] need to issue circulars, which are issued as per the direction of the GST council. Hence, no state member should say that the decision was imposed on them,” the person aware of the council’s decisions said, requesting anonymity.",

    "PMI, GST data indicate economic recovery",
    "“In fact, everything pertaining to GST is an outcome of collective decisions. Therefore, the responsibilities are also shared. Even West Bengal has issued 127 circulars. In one of the meetings of the council, it was decided that states will also issue circulars similar to the Centre. So whenever a circular is issued, the Centre shares it with them.”",
    "The finance ministry did not respond to queries related to the matter.",
    "Commenting on the third anniversary of GST, Abhishek Jain, a tax partner at consultancy firm EY India, said the government has achieved two basic objectives--uniformity and elimination of cascading impact of taxes.",
    "Mahesh Jaising, a partner at Deloitte India, said, “Starting with the fourth year of GST, the regime now embarks on the next phase of maturity. The largely faceless, contactless, and cashless indirect tax regime has been a classic example of how technology-driven policy or system makes a regime effective and efficient,” said Jaising.",
    "“It is paramount that a more simplified assessment and audit framework emerges, as we move to the phase of tax audits by tax authorities. We expect a finer relook into the categorisation of commodities and GST rate rationalisation to meet the challenges arising out of the new economic order or say, the new normal,” he said."

    "“Although the downturn lost further momentum in June, it remained excessively strong as the pandemic curtailed intakes of new work and disrupted business operations. The slower rate of decline was reflective of some stabilisation in activity levels, with around 59% of firms reporting no change in output since May. Meanwhile, only 4% registered growth, while 37% recorded a reduction,” IHS Markit said.",
    "The manufacturing PMI released on Wednesday showed a decline at 47.2 in June, improving from 30.8 recorded in May, signalling faster normalisation of activity since the nationwide lockdown was lifted on June 1. “India’s service sector continued to struggle in June as the country’s Covid-19 crisis worsened. The country is gripped in an unprecedented economic downturn that is going to spill over into the second half of the year unless the infection rate can be brought under control,” said Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit.",
    "Employment across the services sector fell in June. “Job losses were attributed to lower business requirements, although some firms reported poor staff availability. Consequently, there were signs of capacity pressures building as outstanding contracts rose, despite overall activity continuing to fall sharply,” the data analytics firm added. “Business confidence slid to a survey low and also pointed to strongly negative expectations towards activity levels in the year ahead. The heightened risk of a protracted recession was commonly noted by pessimistic firms,” IHS Markit added."

    "According to his autobiography, The Act of Life, Spielberg was denied permission to shoot Temple of Doom in India, and instead set up the film in Sri Lanka, Macau and London. After expressing disinterest in the part, the actor reconsidered after casting director Dolly Thakore sent stills of him from the horror film Gehrayee to Spielberg. ",

Unlike many of our actors in Indian films, there was expertise at all levels, and you couldn’t just do anything and get away with it.”",

    " has said she had earlier distanced herself from films for the sake of personal growth as the refusal of filmmakers to give her a chance to showcase her acting talent pushed her to shift her attention to the other aspects of life. The actor recently made her acting comeback with Season’s Greetings, which revolves around a mother-daughter relationship. ",
    "In an interview with Hindustan Times, Celina shared how an outsider has comparatively lesser opportunities in Bollywood as compared to those with contacts. On being enquired about how outsiders fare in Hindi film industry, Celina said, “That is the reason why I left cinema. You can only try that hard to convince people to cast you. Most of the meaty parts, good roles and good films are reserved for people who have privileges, who either belong to a camp or come from a film family. When you are an outsider, you can try to push and do your best, but then comes a certain limit when you can’t do that anymore. So you have a choice to succumb to the bullying of people and not getting the right offers until you start believing that you are a failure. Or you move on in life and do other things. You recharge, rejuvenate, regenerate and come back again.” ",

    "Celina reveals she realized early that filmmakers only saw her in the roles of a ‘prop’ and refused to give her meatier roles. “For me, it was all about personal growth. What’s the use if I am not happy doing something and if I am feeling that I am constantly being put down and pushed into a corner. I don’t have many allies whom I can turn to  for support. You can only go to people but then you’re constantly turned away. You have an option of doing cinema where you are just a prop. I didn’t want to continue being a prop, there is a lot more to me as a performer. If I am required to be a mannequin or a prop as a performer, I am happy to do that but if you just want to make sure that your screen looks good then I don’t want to do that anymore.”",
    "She goes on to add, “If you want a script, people have a problem giving you the script. They say, ‘apne aap ko bahut bada actor samajhti hai (she considers herself to be a big actor). I started facing it after the first few years of my career because no actor has a success graph which goes all the way up, especially us women.” ",

    "Jun 11, 2020 at 7:13am PDT",
    "Celina also confirmed that not just opportunities, even failures has a different meaning for outsiders in Bollywood. Sharing her part of story amid the ongoing nepotism debate, the actor says, “If a big star’s son or daughter comes on board and even if the first 5 films are complete flops at box office, they continue to work with the best of directors, scriptwriters, best of amenities, makeup, with the best of everything. And in your next film, the benefits that you get of the best designers or directors, it depends on how your last film does. God forbid that last film was not a success, you never get a chance again.”",
    "Celina stepped into modelling at the age of 15 and had her fair share of time in front of the camera. Her Miss India tag landed her debut, Janasheen. She went on to star in quite a few masala entertainers until she was tired of doing the same roles over and over again. “Everything was all glitz and glam, but few films down the line, I realized that I don’t want to be a mannequin on screen anymore,” she says. ",
    "“I am an army officer’s daughter, for me to give up and run away, that’s not going to happen. There has always been a lot more to me than just being an actress,” She adds.",

    " Claiming that better opportunities are reserved for a particular set of people, Celina says, “You realize that you have a talent and you need the right platform and need to work with the right people. When you start going to these people, they turn a blind eye to you. They do not give you that opportunity because those opportunities in our industry are reserved for a privileged few only. You do that again and again and people try to tell you that you are not good enough. You reach a point where you can actually succumb to that.”",
    "“…or you continue growing in all aspects of life which was my personal way of dealing with this. Coming from an army background, I don’t give up that easily. My way of dealing with this was to take a break to do other things in life,” adds the actor who opted for the second option. ",

    "Last year’s Austrian Grand Prix may have given us a glimpse into Formula One’s future. Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen started on the front row—the youngest in F1 history. They raced wheel-to-wheel before Verstappen overtook Leclerc in the homestretch.",
    "Leclerc felt Verstappen should have been penalised for pushing him off the track. Verstappen felt he was just racing. It laid the foundation for a new F1 rivalry, one which would breathe fresh air into the sport, one that everyone was looking forward to in the Australian Grand Prix but the season couldn’t start to the Covid-19 pandemic.",
    "Last season, Verstappen finished third with 278 point with three wins and eight podiums. With an equal number of podiums, Leclerc was fourth with 264 points and two wins.",
    "The revised 2020 Formula One season will begin in Austria on Saturday. Lewis Hamilton will again start as the favourite, seeking his fourth successive title with Mercedes and seventh overall. But the new guard—Verstappen in Red Bull and Leclerc in Ferrari—are mature enough to challenge the Briton and Mercedes’ dominance.",
    "Leclerc and Verstappen are 22. Like most F1 rivalries, theirs began in 2011 at K3 Karting Cup, one of the top events in Europe. On way to winning, Leclerc barged into Verstappen and forced him out. Four years later, Red Bull gave Verstappen a seat at their feeder team Torro Rosso (now AlphaTauri). At 17 years and 166 days, he was the youngest driver ever to start an F1 race.",
    "Aggression, Max style",
    "While Verstappen was criticised for aggressive driving early in his career, he is one of the hottest properties in F1. In 2016, four races into the season, he was bumped up to Red Bull and at 18, became the youngest F1 race winner. Now, there is a feeling in the paddocks that Verstappen, while still aggressive, has matured enough to challenge for the top.",
    "“Max is the hot new guy,” Hamilton told ‘De Telegraaf’. “There’s a big hype around him but the best way to end it is to keep beating him.” Last season was considered as coming of age for Verstappen because he improved every weekend.",
    "Team principal Christian Horner says the 2018 Monaco Grand Prix changed Verstaoppen. There he had damaged his car in practice and couldn’t take part in qualifying. “It was probably the lowest weekend of his career,” said Horner. “That was very tough for him, and I think he went away from that race, and he reflected hard on it.”",
    "Praise from Vettel",
    "Leclerc, who was backed by Ferrari, followed a more traditional path into F1. He raced in the feeder championships, winning the GP 2 and Formula 2 titles in 2016 and 2017 and performed testing duties for Haas and Sauber.",
    "In 2018, he was picked by Sauber and, like Verstappen, earned immediate praise. “If there’s no hype around him then I don’t understand who should be hyped, because when you walk through all the different racing categories like that, then you belong in F1. He’s scoring points in a car that doesn’t belong in the points,” said Vettel of Leclerc, who had scored points in 10 races with Sauber.",
    "Even Vettel wouldn’t have imagined that two seasons later Leclerc would be the lead guy at Ferrari pushing him to the verge of exiting the sport.",
    "While Verstappen is considered to be the fastest on the circuit, Leclerc is more measured and methodical. But that duel in Spielberg in 2019 changed the way Leclerc raced. He became unafraid of the consequences and decided to take on Verstappen, Hamilton and teammate Vettel.",
    "“Last year I lost to Max in Austria, but immediately after that I changed my driving style and I became more aggressive in Silverstone,” Leclerc was quoted as saying by French magazine ‘l’Automobile’ in April.",
    "Three races later, at the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix, Leclerc beat Hamilton for his first win. “It’s not easy for any driver to jump into a top team, let alone Ferrari... and then to be continuous from race one, out-perform, out-qualify and out-drive a four-time world champion is not easy to do. So, there’s a lot more greatness to come from him and I’m looking forward to seeing his growth and racing alongside him,” said Hamilton.",
    "Leclerc though is playing down his chances. “We still have this question mark, and we still need to wait for qualifying to be sure of what we say even though we are 99 per cent sure we will be struggling more than last year,” he said. Leclerc was referring to Ferrari’s inability to get upgrades in the first two races in Austria.",
    "Hamilton though expects a close fight. “It was quite close between the top three teams in testing—I think Red Bull particularly being the closest to us. And Max is progressing year on year, so I anticipate they are going to be strong competitors,” said the 35-year-old.",
    "Verstappen is raring to go as well. “I love it, the more fights on track the better. There are moments where it will be hard but I like that and Lewis likes that as well,” he was quoted as saying by the Guardian.",
    "Hamilton and Vettel have won 10 titles between them since 2010 but there is feeling that change of guard is around the corner. "

Virtual summits of global leaders have been useful platforms to highlight shortcomings of existing arrangements for global cooperation, and to share India’s vision of a new, people-centric template for multilateral cooperation.

At the ministry of external affairs (MEA), we are attempting to find common ground between time-honoured diplomatic protocols and new-age Internet protocols. A crisis of this magnitude requires a coordinated global response, making sustained communication between countries all the more essential. The increase in tensions in different parts of the world, including on the Line of Actual Control between India and China, have only emphasised the criticality of continued communication. If there was no communication with that country, then we would have a much worse situation. Diplomacy has to adapt to new situations. ",

Restrictions on students inflict both short and long-term damage to the US economy and offer no benefits to its citizens. Mr Trump may hope that hitting out at students in a country where a college degree defines middle-class status will appeal to his working-class base.

    "After escalatory rhetoric, and more important, aggressive actions, a process to slowly, in a calibrated manner, defuse the tensions at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), has commenced. China’s slight withdrawal of troops from Galwan, and the Hot Springs Area, and what appears to be a minor thinning of its presence at Finger 4 in Pangong-Tso, is a positive development. With a two-hour-long conversation between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi — the designated special representatives on border talks — there appears to be a degree of convergence between the two countries on the need to first disengage, and eventually de-escalate, from the current stand-off.",
    "There are structural reasons why disengagement makes sense for both countries. China was solely responsible for transgressing across LAC. Even the finest scholars who study China have not been able to offer a fully rounded explanation on why Beijing has behaved the way it did. Is it linked to its pattern of aggression elsewhere? Is it to overcome domestic legitimacy issues Xi Jinping may be confronting? Is it a message to India to not cosy up to the United States? Is it to halt India’s border infrastructure development? Is it to gain tactical advantage to secure Aksai Chin and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor? Beijing may have been motivated by all these factors, but the fact is, even for a rising power, its actions defied rational calculation, for it has alienated India, and Indian public opinion entirely, throwing the entire relationship — of which China too has been a beneficiary — off-gear. It will also push India in the very direction Beijing does not want it to move. If Beijing is now waking up to what is a miscalculation, that is wise. New Delhi too does not want conflict. It was left with no choice but to respond aggressively to Chinese incursions and defend its territorial integrity. But given the internal economic weaknesses, the Covid-19 challenge, the gaps in military preparation, and the costs of any conflict, peace is, of course, the most desirable option.",
    "But this seeming thaw needs to be accompanied with two caveats. One is immediate. As the Indian establishment has made clear, every step of the disengagement process will be carefully monitored and verified. China has violated past understandings; its statement contained a hint of continued belligerence; and there doesn’t appear to be a deal on it stepping back from the finger area in Pangong-Tso. India must ensure complete restoration of ",
    "status quo ante",
    ". The second is medium-term. Irrespective of a possible de-escalation, it cannot be business-as-usual. India must ramp up its capabilities, deepen external partnerships, reduce dependence on China, and remain wary, for this is possibly the beginning, not the end, of an era of a new strategic competition."

    "“If you’re gonna be two-faced, at least make one of them pretty,” Marilyn Monroe once said. She was speaking about hypocrites but she could have been referring to India’s education establishment. Our hypocrisy is rooted in many myths which will be challenged in the post- Covid-19 world where only the efficient, the nimble and the innovative will survive. Unfortunately, the latest National Education Policy, soon to come up for Cabinet approval, has not faced up to this reality.",
    "One of our myths is that education must only be delivered by the government if it is to serve the public good. Hence, private schools are tolerated based on, one, a  hypocritical lie which forbids them from making a profit, when everyone knows that most, in fact, do and, two, that the State will shackle them in a licence raj to ensure that they behave. One myth is based on the mistaken belief that education in advanced countries is provided by the State. The  truth is that recent education reforms in the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), and even socialist Scandinavian countries have encouraged private initiatives. Many schools there are moving to a privately-run/publicly-funded model. ",
    "In pursuit of the myth, India made huge investments in government schools.But the outcome has been pitiable. India’s children ranked 73rd out of 74 countries in the Programme for International Student Assessment test, just ahead of Kyrgyzstan. Between 2010-11 and 2017-18, 24 million children have abandoned State schools in favour of private schools, according to the government’s Unified District Information System for Education data. Today 47% of India’s children are in private schools, making our private schooling system, with 120 million children, the third-largest in the world. In this system, 70% of parents pay a monthly fee of less than Rs 1,000 per month and 45% parents pay less than Rs 500 — busting another myth that private schools are for the elite. ",
    "Based on the speed at which government schools are emptying out, another 130,000 more private schools are needed. It is a heartbreaking sight to see long lines of parents waiting to get their child into a decent school. There are three reasons for the scarcity of good private schools. One is the licence raj. It is very difficult for an honest person to start a school. At least 35 to 125 permissions are required, depending on the state, and most require running around and bribery. The most expensive bribes are for an Essentiality Certificate (to prove that a school is needed) and Recognition. This can take up to five years.",
    "A second reason is financial. Running a school is no longer lucrative. The problem began with the Right to Education Act, when government commanded private schools to reserve 25% seats for the poor. It was a good idea, but poorly executed. Since state governments did not compensate private schools properly for reserved students, the fees for the 75% fee-paying students went up. This led to a clamour from parents and many states imposed a control on fees, which has gradually weakened the financial health of schools. To survive, schools have had to economise, leading to a decline in quality. Some schools have shut down. More will, after the pandemic.",
    "A third reason why an honest person won’t open a school is national hypocrisy. The law forbids a private school from making a profit but most schools do. Nine out of the top 10 economies in the world allow for-profit education. India is the only one that does not. It is high time we dropped this pretence. This single change from a non-profit to profit sector could create a revolution. Investments would flow into education, improving choice and quality. Principals would not have to lie or be called thieves. Black money will be curbed. After 1991, parents value choice and competition. Just as they pay for water, electricity and the Internet, they will pay for a superior education. ",
    "This revolution will require other steps. Opening up honest private school education will require removing the licence raj. Second, schools will need the sort of autonomy that exists in advanced countries. Today, barring a few exceptions, most Indian private schools are mediocre. Schools will only invest in post-Covid-19 technologies if there is predictable regulation and freedom of salaries, fees, and curriculum. A vibrant private school sector will deliver better outcomes for India and it will do so at one-third the cost of government schools. The principal reason is teachers’ salaries — the starting salary of a junior teacher in Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 2017-18 was Rs 48,918/ pm, or 11 times the per capita income of UP. ",
    "The latest education policy, like the previous ones, is likely to miss the mark. Reform of India’s education should have two objectives: One, improve the quality of government schools, and, two, give autonomy to private schools. To this end, the government must also separate its own functions of regulating education and running government schools. Today, there is a conflict of interest which results in bad outcomes for all. Finally, opening up the private sector will make us more honest — schools will no longer have to lie about making a profit and the establishment will not have to preach the virtue of government schools while sending its own children to private schools.

    "The Covid-19 pandemic has taught India several painful lessons. The first is that we can no longer continue with the ruthless exploitation of nature. The climate crisis, erratic weather phenomena, pollution of air, land and ocean have pushed the country, and the world, to a dangerous brink. Unless this is reversed immediately, we are in for serious trouble by the end of the century. It is extraordinary that the lockdown period has led to nature regenerating. We saw blue skies again after many decades, pollution levels dropped, and several species of animals, birds and insects staged a comeback. We must try and ensure that these positive developments are sustained so that we do not revert to the old normal, but adopt a new normal vis-à-vis nature. ",
    "The second lesson is that India needs a drastic restructuring of its developmental plans which involves allocating at least 3% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each to health and education. If the country does not strengthen these sectors, all plans of becoming a world-class power are doomed to fail. It has been a national failure that we have not done so since Independence. It is also clear that in a vast federal country such as India, a crisis like this demands close cooperation between the Centre and the states, regardless of which political party is in power. Health is a state subject, and in the final analysis, it is the states and the Union territories that have to deal with the crisis on the ground. This is an area where cooperative federalism rather than confrontational federalism is required. ",
    "Third, despite efforts of leaders such as the United States (US) President Donald Trump to trash the concept of globalisation, the fact remains that international collaboration in crises like this is essential. This applies to the quest for a vaccine as well as the availability of medicines and personal protective equipment. As our ancient concept of ",
    "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam",
    " (the world is one family) tells us, in the final analysis, no nation, howsoever great, can be an island unto itself. The human race will ultimately sink or swim together. We have some of the best scientists and researchers in the world, and several of India’s laboratories are working overtime to find a vaccine against the coronavirus. Here again, cooperation with the laboratories in other countries will be of great value. ",
    "I led the Indian delegation to the World Health Organization (WHO) general conference on several occasions as health minister. In its building in Geneva, there is a beautiful Nataraja image that I presented to the then director-general Dr H Mahler when he visited Delhi to celebrate the eradication of smallpox worldwide. Despite WHO coming in for criticism recently, I feel we must continue to cooperate with it fully and take advantage of its organisational expertise.",
    "The fourth lesson is that the intolerable sufferings of millions of migrant workers due to the sudden lockdown, and the lack of preparedness for their welfare, will remain a matter of deep shame to the nation. This teaches us that there has to be a safety net for the most vulnerable sections of society — the one-quarter of India’s population that still lives below the poverty line. Apart from other measures, an assured minimum income credited directly into their accounts is the only way to achieve this. This is the least that India can do as a nation. This can be achieved with the restructuring of India’s financial planning and reorienting its monetary policy. ",
    "Fifth, the virus has forced us to revisit family relationships and to extend support and affection, particularly to the elderly. Reports of increased domestic violence during the lockdown are disturbing. This is the opposite of what is needed. Existing laws need to be strictly enforced because any improper behaviour towards women, children or the elderly is unacceptable and against the tenets of Indian culture. The Covid-19 crisis has also impelled us to change personal lifestyles in a manner that unnecessary expenditure on luxury items has been minimised. That some of us can afford to spend on these is no justification for avoidable expenditure. The vulgar and grossly over-the-top engagement and wedding ceremonies, along with hugely wasteful banquets and receptions, should be restricted by law by designating a limited guest list, say, 50 people. With millions not getting one square meal a day, it is nothing short of criminal to waste so much money on so few. ",
    "Finally, the virus has taught us the benefits of silence and solitude so that we can look into ourselves and explore the deeper recesses of our consciousness. We are so involved in superficial activities that we seldom get time to look within. In the ultimate analysis, it is our inner consciousness that will express itself in our actions and relationships. If we can find deep within ourselves the divine light that is the core of our beings, this will uplift not only each individual but society at large."

    "The Dalai Lama marked his 85th birthday on Monday. He has now lived for 61 of those 85 years as a treasured guest of India, and has added value, in both tangible and intangible ways, to Indian public life, its soft power and its global reputation. The Dalai Lama is a symbol of an oppressed community which had to flee its homeland because of China’s territorial aggression; he is representative of the great Gandhian tradition of non-violence; he is a religious and spiritual icon who has inspired hundreds of thousands of people, outside his own community, to seek the true meaning of life; and he is a living reflection of the shared Buddhist heritage of India and its independent neighbour for centuries, Tibet.",
    "But it is equally true that India’s hospitality has been often tempered with geopolitics. The fear of antagonising China has often meant that Indian governments — including the current dispensation — have been inconsistent in their approach to Tibet. From recognising Chinese suzerainty over Tibet to giving the Dalai Lama a home and collaborating with the United States in encouraging a rebellion, from deploying the “Tibet card” sporadically to refusing to even engage with the Tibetan leader, India’s approach, to Tibet, has, for too long, been subject to its dynamic with China at any particular point.",
    "It is now time to evolve a consistent approach. China, of course, sees Tibet as a “core interest” — an ever expanding circle to make its redlines clear. India has sought to respect this. But clearly, China has no hesitation in attacking India’s core interest, of which territorial integrity is at the top. Delhi now needs to shed its hesitation, not just because Tibet is a “card”, but is intertwined with the values of freedom and peace central to the vision to resist China. Delhi must take the following steps. One, honour the Dalai Lama with the Bharat Ratna. Two, speak up for Tibetan rights at international platforms. Three, deepen linkages with the new generation of Tibetan activists who are at the forefront of the new resistance. Four, rebuild links with all Tibetan sects, some of which have got caught in the web of bureaucratic battles in India. And most important, declare that India will respect the wishes of the Dalai Lama on his succession — making it clear that China will not have its way in installing a puppet Dalai Lama. Taking on “an expansionist” China must begin from a commitment to Tibet where it first displayed imperial ambitions."

    "On Monday, the University Grants Commission (UGC) issued fresh guidelines for conducting exams in colleges and universities. The Union minister of human resource development (HRD), Ramesh Pokhriyal, tweeted the guidelines that recommend that students in non-terminal semesters should be promoted to the next semester based on internal assessments and their previous performance. But those in final semesters will receive their degrees only after appearing for online or in-person written exams. The Centre’s and UGC’s decision has led to disillusionment and resentment among students. The decision is regressive; it exposes the deep-rooted conservatism and orthodoxy of India’s education administrators and their apathy to the problems young people face.  ",
    "The recommendations have come amid forceful opposition by student bodies across the country. The disruption caused by Covid-19 has united a cross-section of students who are demanding that the proposed final semester exams be cancelled. Classes have been suspended, study materials have been inaccessible, and e-learning is still nascent. If students have not received a normal education this semester, what are they being tested on? ",
    "The government’s justification is that degrees cannot be handed out without conducting “final” assessments of students. But India’s universities do not have final exams. The semester system replaced the annual system and each semester is an equal and independent unit. If the public health crisis justifies promoting second-semester students to the third semester without their being asked to take a traditional written exam, the same must apply to a final semester student. Why are they being held to a different standard? ",
    "It is not set in stone that degrees may be awarded to students only when they clear a written exam. This is an archaic and orthodox approach. Some of the finest universities around the world award degrees to their students after conducting rigorous internal assessments -- assignments, term papers, theses, and even open book exams are legitimate tests of calibre. ",
    "On the contrary, the assessments used in Indian colleges perpetuate a rote-learning based education that is far from perfect. In the face of the Covid-19 challenge, some universities have innovated: The Ambedkar University conducted its evaluation through internal assessments. The National Law University, Delhi, has combined internal assessments and online open-book exams, but with 48 hours being allowed for submissions, unlike the three hours that Delhi University is giving its students. ",
    "The Centre is being unnfair towards students by excluding their opinion. Students have made their voices heard on social media; some have even gone to court to challenge the government’s decision. ",
    "Students are key stakeholders of this system and must be treated as such. After Delhi University’s online mock tests this week were marred by several glitches, the administration denied any problems with their online testing infrastructure and blamed the poor Internet connectivity of the students. Even if that were the case, clearly the system is not ready. ",
    "We are in the middle of a pandemic that has thrown the world off course. The economy is comatose and a disproportionate number of fresh graduates are going to remain unemployed for the foreseeable future. This is already causing tremendous anxiety. The added stress and toll of full-fledged exams are unnecessary and avoidable. Puritanical standards of what it takes to be a graduate in India must be substituted  by a more humane and rational approach in the current circumstances.",

    "The minister said India has used the novel coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity because of the “whole of government’ approach adopted at various levels.   From January 8, one day after China alerted the world about the pathogen, the government has coordinated among its different branches for point of entry surveillance at the sea, land ports and airports, Vardhan said.",
    "It strengthened its community surveillance, issued detailed health and travel advisories, and also evacuated thousands of citizens and foreign nationals.   “India now has over 100 PPE manufacturing units manufacturing 5 lakh PPE per day and has also similarly ramped up its production of N95 masks and ventilators.",
    "“India has supplied Hydrochloroxyquine to more than 100 countries,” Vardhan told his Swedish counterpart during the interaction.    The two health ministers discussed in detail the status and containment measures for Covid-19 in the two countries, and the future vision for handling it, according to the statement.",

Its exit means Hong Kong users, like those in mainland China, will now be cut off from the global version.",

    "The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday came down heavily on state bodies for failing to preserve the 113-hectare Lonar Crater Lake in Buldhana district.",
    "The Lake, declared a notified National Geo-heritage Monument in 1979, had turned reddish-pink since June 9-10 due to high salinity, acidity (pH) and an algal bloom, the forest department had said. However, the exact reasons are yet to be confirmed by research bodies. The district collector and forest department both said the natural lake colour was restored last week following heavy rains.",
    "The HC bench noted that the Geological Survey of India (GSI) had conducted a survey of the pink water and will submit a report within a week, while reports from scientific bodies such as the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and Agarkar Research Institute, Pune will be submitted before the next hearing on July 22.",
    "For Coronavirus Live Updates",
    "On Monday, the HC bench of Justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor was hearing hearing a 2009 petition by lawyer Kirti Atul Nipankar and others against various state bodies and it rapped the Buldhana district administration, Lonar municipal council, and public works department (PWD) for their indifference to previous HC orders, callous approach in conserving the lake. The court also cautioned that further disobedience of its orders could lead to contempt proceedings against erring authorities.",
    "Based on submissions, the bench highlighted two issues of immediate concern, open defecation by Lonar citizens at the lake including in the area where the sewage treatment plant (STP) is located and discharge of sewage water from Lonar city freely entering the lake.",
    "During the last hearing on June 15, the HC had taken cognisance of the change in lake’s colour, open defecation and improper sewage treatment and directed four senior lawyers to visit the crater and submit a status report. The inspection was undertaken on June 17.",
    "The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19",
    "“The inspection report has now been placed on record. We find that the situation at and around Lonar Lake is really pathetic,” the bench said in its 12-page order published on Tuesday.",
    "“The pathetic situation has arisen mainly because of the indifference rather callous indifference of many of the authorities responsible in their own way for conservation and preservation of Lonar Crater Lake.”",
    "Meanwhile, the bench took serious note of Buldhana collector’s alleged failures to implement HC directions and to attend court hearings, not even through video conferencing for the latest hearing and in person prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.",
    "“We are of the prima-facie view that the Buldhana collector.. has failed in discharging fundamental duties in the recent past, thereby owing an explanation to this court, for dislodgement of the prima facie impression,” the bench said.",
    "Suman Chandra, district collector and magistrate, Buldhana said, “There has been no intentional negligence. Over the past three months, there was a delay due to Covid-19. Special efforts will be made to ensure that all directions of the HC are complied with at the earliest. Meanwhile, the lake colour has normalised after rain that led to dilution. The colour had turned pink due to the increased salinity.”",
    "The bench also directed the civic body to furnish documental evidence of increased STP capacity (from 500 kilo litres per day to 1000 KLD) by July 22, and ensure untreated sewage is stopped from entering the lake within three days from the order date.",
    "Located 500 km from Mumbai and over 90 km from Buldhana city, the oval shaped Lonar Lake is a part of the 383-hectare Lonar Wildlife Sanctuary declared on June 8, 2000.",
    "The lake has an average diameter of over 6,000 feet and is 449-feet deep. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it was formed by a meteorite impact between 35,000 and 50,000 years ago. It was identified as a unique geographical site by a British officer C J E Alexander in 1823. A combined area of 366-hectare of Lonar Lake and surrounding regions was first proposed to be declared as a Ramsar site, a wetland of ecological importance in 2017 by the state forest department."

    "A Brazilian man infected with the AIDS virus has shown no sign of it for more than a year since he stopped HIV medicines after an intense experimental drug therapy aimed at purging hidden, dormant virus from his body, doctors reported Tuesday.",
    "The case needs independent verification and it’s way too soon to speculate about a possible cure, scientists cautioned.",
    "“These are exciting findings but they’re very preliminary,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an AIDS specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. “This has happened to one person, and one person only,” and it didn’t succeed in four others given the same treatment, she said.",
    "Another UCSF specialist, Dr. Steven Deeks, said: “This is not a cure,” just an interesting case that merits more study.",
    "The case was described at an AIDS conference where researchers also disclosed an important prevention advance: A shot of an experimental medicine every two months worked better than daily Truvada pills to help keep uninfected gay men from catching HIV from an infected sex partner. Hundreds of thousands of people take these “pre-exposure prevention” pills now and the shot could give a new option, almost like a temporary vaccine.",
    "If the Brazil man’s case is confirmed, it would be the first time HIV has been eliminated in an adult without a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Independent experts want to see whether his remission lasts and for the intense drug combination that he received to undergo more testing.",
    "“I’m very moved because it’s something that millions of people want,” said the 35-year-old man, whose spoke to The Associated Press on condition that his name not be published. “It’s a gift of life, a second chance to live.”",
    "Transplants are how two other men, nicknamed the Berlin and London patients for where they were treated, were cured previously.",
    "“I’m the living proof it’s possible to be cured,” Adam Castillejo, the London patient, said in a news conference at the AIDS meeting, which is being held online because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
    "He and the Berlin patient, Timothy Ray Brown, had donors with a gene that confers natural immunity to HIV infection. Such transplants are too medically risky and impractical to attempt on a large scale, so doctors have been trying other approaches.",
    "It’s hard to eliminate HIV because it establishes an early “reservoir” of blood cells where it lies dormant and can’t be attacked by medicines or the immune system. Infections can be controlled with drugs, but as soon as patients stop taking them, the dormant virus activates and renews the disease.",
    "Dr. Ricardo Diaz of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil led a study testing strong and new drug combinations to try to purge this reservoir.",
    "“We are trying to wake up the virus” and boost the immune system’s ability to eliminate it once it’s flushed out of hiding, Diaz explained. The Brazil man had been taking a standard three-drug combo to suppress his virus. In September 2015, Diaz added two newer ones to intensify his treatment — dolutegravir and maraviroc — plus nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3 that may help expose dormant virus.",
    "After nearly a year, the patient went back to the standard three drugs for two more years, then stopped all HIV medicines in March 2019. The virus has been undetectable in many blood and tissue samples since then.",
    "“We can’t search the entire body, but by the best evidence, we do not have infected cells,” Diaz said.",
    "The most convincing evidence: Tests show the man has lost nearly all HIV antibodies — substances the immune system makes when fighting the virus.",
    "Eager for independent verification, the patient said he went to a counseling center for an anonymous HIV test in February. It was negative.",
    "“He made a picture of the results” and sent a photo of them, Diaz said.",
    "The antibody results are “the most fascinating part of this story,” said Deeks. “These are solid scientists” and “the team may have come up with something that helps,” but it’s going to take verification of these results and much more testing to know, he said.",
    "In particular, doctors will want to see proof from blood tests that the patient truly had stopped his HIV medicines. Diaz said all HIV patients in Brazil get their medicines from a government health program and that he verified the man had stopped.",
    "“I think it’s very promising. This patient might be cured,” but it will take more time to know, Diaz said.",
    "The treatment did not succeed in four others treated the same way, or in any of the others in the 30-person study testing related approaches.",
    "Diaz said he has approval for a new study in 60 patients, sponsored by government grants in Brazil and by ViiV Healthcare, the British company that makes maraviroc.",
    "Dr. Anton Pozniak, head of the AIDS conference and an HIV specialist at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, said more time is needed to see if the virus rebounds.",
    "“I’m waiting. I’m a skeptic about all of this ... until a couple of years go by,” he said.",
    "The separate study on prevention involved nearly 4,600 people in North and South America, Asia, and Africa. It tested shots of ViiV’s experimental drug cabotegravir against daily pills of Truvada, the Gilead Sciences drug already approved for preventing HIV infection.",
    "The study was stopped early, in May, when the shot seemed at least as effective as the pills. Final results now show the shot works better — there were 13 new infections among those who got it versus 39 among those taking Truvada, said the study leader, Dr. Raphael Landovitz of the University of California, Los Angeles.",
    "“People can stay protected without having taken a pill every day,” he said. “You get a shot and you don’t have to do anything for two months. That’s incredibly powerful.”",
    "The results “could revolutionize prevention for HIV worldwide” and give a new option for people who don’t want to take a daily pill, Gandhi said.",
    "ViiV has said it will seek U.S. approval for cabotegravir; its eventual price is unknown. Truvada costs $1,600 to $1,800 a month, but what patients pay out of pocket depends on insurance and other factors. With either drug, people are still urged to use condoms to prevent other sexually spread diseases."

    "He also revealed he was not getting his due at the professional front during this time. “After working in many TV shows, people had started recognising my work, but suddenly, everything went downhill. In the entertainment industry, uncertainty is the only certain thing and everyone goes through it. I used to get selected for TV shows, but in the end, I would be replaced by someone else. It became a pattern and I was replaced in almost five shows. This was also the time when I was going through a bad phase in my relationship. After a few months, I realised that I was suffering from depression. Even in my sleep, I used to choke on my tears and I would wake up crying. It would take me hours to calm down,” he told the daily.

    "After verifying his friend list, she accepted his request, police said.",
    "According to the complainant, during the course of their friendship, he also promised to marry her and even took her to Leh, Ladakh on a vacation. After winning her confidence, he induced her that he wanted to start a hotel business before their marriage and asked her to transfer Rs 34 lakh in his bank account.",

    "Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said based on her complaint, a case was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property).

The actor started out as a radio jockey and even participated in hit reality show, MTV Roadies. Almost 15 years after he won the show’s second season in 2004, a throwback video of his audition tape has resurfaced on social media. ",
    "The video shows a bespectacled Ayushmann sitting meekly in front of the fearsome judges, including the most brutal of them all, Raghu Ram. Ayushmann is seen talking about his merits and why he deserves to be on the show.   “Dost banana meri khoobi hi nahi mera pesha bhi hai (making friends is not just something I am good at but it is also what my job is),” he says in the video.",

If I would’ve straightaway gone to become an actor at 19, I wouldn’t have left an impact,” he said.",

    "President Donald Trump has made his position clear: “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” he tweeted Monday. As Covid-19 surges in parts of the US, many teachers aren’t convinced.",
    "The pandemic’s ever-shifting nature has robbed school districts of the ability to plan with certainty -- not only for instruction, but to provide protective equipment and intensive cleaning. Even if a sustained decline in infections allows them to open their doors, many are preparing a mix of in-person and remote education that is certain to fall short of the president’s expectations.",
    "Click here for full Covid-19 coverage",
    "“The reality is that they have to map out several scenarios for the fall with the real possibility that they don’t know what the scenario will be on the first day of school,” said Betheny Gross, associate director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington at Bothell, which has been tracking districts’ responses to the coronavirus shutdown.",
    "In Washington on Tuesday, Trump will host a gathering of health and education leaders -- as well as students and parents -- for an event billed as a “National Dialogue on Safely Reopening America’s Schools.”",
    "The event comes as many students approach five months without setting foot in a classroom. Proponents of returning say distance learning is hobbling children’s development and the economy, with parents trying to juggle work and their offspring. Many teachers say they’re well aware of the benefits of face-to-face instruction, but worry about endangering students and peers.",
    "“The Trump Administration is committed to working in partnership with university presidents, superintendents, principals, counselors, teachers, health professionals, parents, and students to ensure in-person learning resumes in a safe and healthy way,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.",
    "Economic drag",
    "Trump’s demand that schools open this fall was a reminder of how politicized the issue has become. “It’s not surprising,” said Douglas Harris, chair of the Department of Economics at Tulane University in New Orleans and a public-education expert. “",
    "The economy can’t really open back up again",
    " until kids go back to school.”",
    "Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, the nation’s biggest teachers union, said schools need a massive allocation of federal stimulus funds to purchase protective equipment and hire cleaners. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday predicted Congress this month will pass one final rescue package.",
    "Teachers agree that remote instruction isn’t optimal, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. The real debate, she said, is around how to return to school safely -- and the need for money to do it right.",
    "“Either you have to be a moron about not understanding how government or schools work, or you have to be really callous and craven that you’d wait till the end, till it’s almost too late,” Weingarten said.",
    "To maintain social distancing, schools will have to use lunchrooms, gyms, libraries and trailers as classrooms. Some are considering rotating classes in mornings and afternoons or three days a week. Others may keep older pupils online, while using high-school classrooms for younger children who don’t learn well via Zoom, Garcia said.",
    "Gross said schools may also need to rotate through different scenarios as the school year goes on and the pandemic changes anew.",
    "In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday reiterated that no decision has been made on whether students across the state will be able to return for in-person learning in the fall.",
    "“We obviously very much would like to,” Cuomo said, adding that New York City and 700 school districts are in the process of developing reopening plans that must be submitted to the state.",
    "In Texas, where Covid-19 cases have surged since the state embarked on one of the country’s most aggressive reopening plans, most teachers surveyed by the Houston Federation of Teachers have said they would prefer to not return to in-person learning until it is “safe,” according to Andy Dewey, the group’s executive vice president.",
    "Defining safe",
    "“The definition of safe is where we have disagreement,” he said by phone Monday. “The problem is this: The district hasn’t given us any guidance on it because the district says the state hasn’t given any guidance on it.”",
    "The latest survey conducted by the El Paso branch of the AFT showed that just 7% of 790 respondents were in favor of full face-to-face learning at the start of the school year. About 20% said they supported a “hybrid” return, while roughly 72% said they favored remote learning. The city and surrounding area’s two main school districts both plan to start the first few weeks of the year virtually.",
    "Teachers for the Houston Independent School District have until the end of this week to decide whether they want to resign to avoid potentially being required to return to classrooms. After that, they risk having their teaching certificates suspended for a year if they defy an in-person start to the school year, with a permanent notation that could make it harder for them to get hired in other districts, Dewey said.",
    "Leslie LaFollette, a third-grade teacher at Kiker Elementary in Austin, said she’s prepared to move to Massachusetts, where her wife has family, if educators aren’t allowed to stick to online learning.",
    "“It’s drastic, but I’m willing to do that if we lose the option,” said LaFollette, 46. “I miss my kids, I want to be with them. But not to the detriment of their health and my health.”",
    "In Seattle, ",
    "site of the first major US outbreak",
    ", officials are pursuing a hybrid reopening. Parents have been asked to fill out a questionnaire with their preferences so the district can plan. In August, families must finalize their pick.",
    "“We’re focusing on making that as equitable and safe as possible,” said Julie Popper, spokeswoman for the Seattle Educational Association, which represents some 6,000 members, including teachers and staff.",
    "Before opening, the union wants to make sure Seattle is spending enough on staff and protective equipment to meet state health and safety rules, as well as adding custodial workers to disinfect, and having nurses and mental-health professionals in every school daily, Popper said.",
    "Peer interaction",
    "In North Carolina, Angie Mangin is optimistic about getting her two incoming eighth-graders back to school, especially her daughter, after having them home-learning since March.",
    "“My son wasn’t too affected by the change, but my daughter needs that interaction with her peers,” said Mangin, 54, who works in the insurance and risk department of Circle K convenience stores.",
    "Tulane’s Harris, who studies the economics of education and education policy, said there’s simply no guarantee everyone is going back. “It’s hard to imagine that schools will reopen fully in person on a large scale,” he said.",
    "Trump, who avoids wearing a mask in public and has convened rallies without social-distancing requirements, has urged local governments to reopen. Stacy Davis Gates, vice president of the Chicago Teachers Union and executive vice president of the Illinois Federation of Teachers, said she didn’t trust him to lead on education policy.",
    "“President Trump has been virtually missing in action with respect to keeping Americans safe countrywide,” Gates said. “It gives me a great amount of anxiety to know that he is going to set the standard for my children and America’s children.”"

As he completes 11 years in the entertainment industry, he says that he cannot discount the significance of the television industry in his career. He shares, “A lot of people tell me that it would’ve been great if I didn’t do television. It’s very easy to look at things in hindsight and say that if I didn’t do TV, I would’ve cracked my first film a long time back. But I don’t think I want to change anything. I genuinely believe that your experiences shape your future and mould you.” ",

    "Tacker confides that the struggle to prove himself still continues. He elaborates, “When I set out to do something bigger, the constant disregard for being a TV actor was tough to go through. I was constantly pulled down by people who told me that they weren’t very keen on working with actors from the TV industry. We’re made to believe that TV actors cannot pull off roles that are of a certain mountain and intensity.”",
    "So what’s the big dream? “Matthew McConaughey who’s doing a television series called True Detective ends up winning an Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club (2013). That’s the kind of career I hope for. I want to explore all mediums. I want to be part of good scripts. I also hope that after Special Ops, people look at me as a serious actor and not just a good looking guy,” he says. ",

While picking up paints and trying my hands at painting, I discovered my love for charcoal sketching. I look at pictures online and replicate them and give them my own twist. I think it’s a nice way of giving back to society by auctioning my paintings and sketches and raising money in these tough times for anyone in need.”"

    "The ",

    " was published online in the Journal of Medical Genetics.",
    "Deafness in adults is known to be inherited. But, unlike childhood deafness, the genetic causes largely remain a mystery, say the researchers, who suggest that their discovery makes it an ideal candidate for gene therapy.",
    "Deafness is one of the most prevalent disabilities worldwide and has a major impact on the quality of life. So far, 118 genes have been associated with the heritable form. Variants in these genes explain a large proportion of congenital and childhood deafness, but not adult deafness.",
    "This is despite the fact that between 30 per cent and 70 per cent of hearing loss in adults is thought to be inherited.",
    "The researchers had already discovered the chromosomal region involved in hearing loss in one family, but not the gene involved.",
    "To explore this further, they carried out gene sequencing of this family among whom hearing loss in one or both ears had occurred as well as 11 other families (200 people in all).",
    "Each family member had a general ear, nose and throat check and their hearing was tested in both ears.",
    "The genetic sequencing in the first family revealed a missing section of the RIPOR2 gene in 20 of the 23 family members with confirmed hearing loss.",
    "But this genetic variant was also found in three other family members aged 23, 40, and 51, who didn’t yet have any hearing loss.",
    "This prompted the researchers to carry out gene sequencing, and the same medical and hearing examinations, in a further 11 families affected by hearing loss.",
    "The identical genetic variant was found in 39 of 40 family members with confirmed hearing loss as well as in two people aged 49 and 50 who weren’t affected by hearing loss.",
    "What’s more, the RIPOR2 genetic variant was found in a further 18 out of 22,952 randomly selected people for whom no information on hearing loss was available.",
    "Four family members with hearing loss didn’t have the RIPOR2 genetic variant. Their deafness might have been associated with heavy smoking or genetic abnormalities other than that in RIPOR2, suggest the researchers.",
    "While the particular manifestations of this genetically induced hearing loss varied, as did the age at which hearing problems began, its prevalence suggests that it is common (highly penetrant) and that many thousands of people might be at risk of deafness as a result, explain the researchers.",
    "Based on their findings the researchers estimate that in The Netherlands alone the RIPOR2 genetic variant is likely to present “in more than 13,000 individuals who are therefore at risk of developing [hearing loss] or who have developed [hearing loss] already due to this variant.”",
    "And they suggest that a further 30,000 people in northern Europe are likely to have this genetic variant and therefore be at risk of deafness.",
    "“Because of the large number of subjects estimated to be at risk for [hearing loss] due to the c.1696_1707 del RIPOR2 variant, it is an attractive target for the development of gene therapy,” they conclude. ",

    "Perceptions of park-centered crime may keep New Yorkers from using them, no matter how close parks are to home. ",
    "Researchers",
    " at NYU Grossman School of Medicine found that New Yorkers are more likely to exercise in a park if they believe they live very close to it. In turn, they feel less anxious and less depressed the more often they exercise there -- but only if they are not concerned about being safe.",
    "“Living near a park may not be enough to improve your physical and mental well-being through exercise,” says study lead author Stephanie Orstad, PhD, a ",
    "research",
    " assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at NYU Langone Health. “If we want to make the most of the abundant health benefits parks offer, then we need to make them not only accessible but also safe for everyone.”",
    "Many past studies have linked the availability of urban green spaces to lower stress levels, weight, and risk of heart disease, the study authors say. Other work has shown that living closer to a park leads to fewer days of anxiety and depression.",
    "The new study is the latest to suggest that safety concerns could interfere with mental health advantages that park proximity offers New Yorkers, Orstad says.",
    "For the investigation, the researchers analysed responses from more than 3,800 New Yorkers who completed the city’s 2010-2011 Physical Activity and Transit Survey. The assessment tracked the participants’ mental health, as well as how long they estimated it would take them to walk from home to the nearest park. The survey also asked participants to estimate how often they used the park to exercise or play sports.",
    "Nearly twice as many people said they exercised in the nearest park “sometimes,” or “often” if they lived less than a five-minute walk away, compared with people who estimated living more than 30 minutes away, the researchers say. In addition, people who described themselves as “frequent” park exercisers reported having one fewer day of mental health issues a month compared to people who said they “rarely” or “never” were active in their local park.",
    "However, the closeness of a local park made no difference in park use for those who worried about crime in the area. According to Orstad, improving cleanliness and lighting along paths, offering more park-based programs, and fostering a sense of community could help make parks feel safer. She emphasized that the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the importance of such communal programs because parks are one of the few remaining places where people can get out of their homes, be active, and connect (from a distance) with their neighbours.",
    "“Investing in park safety offers a practical way of improving physical and mental health in different communities in the city, especially in areas where there are stigmas associated with seeking help,” says senior study author Melanie Jay, MD, MS, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine and Population Health at NYU Langone. “It takes advantage of resources that may already exist in the neighbourhood.”",
    "Next, the research team plans to investigate ways to improve a community’s perceptions of its neighbourhood park to increase opportunities for exercise and mental health. ",

    "While popular vacation destinations in Europe are still closed to visitors from Russia and Ukraine as European nations move carefully to lift restrictions on foreign visitors, Black Sea resorts in Russia and Ukraine are filled to capacity from domestic tourism.",
    "“We usually go abroad: the Emirates, Tunisia, Turkey, and we did plan to go again this year,” Tatyana Kofler, a Russian who is spending her summer leave in Sochi, said. “But then our plans changed.”",
    "The owners of beaches that require a fee place lounge chairs at required intervals, but on the city’s public beaches few visitors appeared concerned with trying to avoid COVID-19 by maintaining a safe distance.",

    "“Our hotel is booked to the max, and the projections are very optimistic, because preliminary bookings indicate the load will remain very good up to November,” said David Vardanyan, a Sochi hotel owner.",
    "In the past, many Russians who live in the eastern part of a country that spans 11 time zones took vacations in Thailand, China or Vietnam to save money on air travel. Those destinations remain off-limits to foreigners, too, for now, helping swell the numbers of people streaming westward to Sochi and the Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.",
    "Last year, Sochi and other resorts in the Krasnodar region of Russia attracted 17 million tourists, most of them Russian, while about 7 million visited Crimea. In comparison, 18 million Russians spent their vacations abroad in 2019. Some 7 million traveled to Turkey, about 1.5 million visited Thailand, 1.2 million spent their vacations in Spain and about 1 million visited Italy among other foreign destinations.",
    "Now, Russian sun-lovers are left with the narrow pebble beaches of Sochi or Crimea as their only beach vacation options.",
    "A 19-kilometer (12-mile) bridge to Crimea that opened in 2018 facilitated travel to the region, but it has suffered from freshwater shortages and rationing resulting from Ukraine cutting supplies. Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, a move that Ukraine and most of the world regards as illegal, problems that overshadow the attractiveness of the Black Sea peninsula’s beautiful coast and scenic mountains.",
    "Both in Sochi and Crimea, popular hotels that offer European standards of comfort already are fully booked for the summer.",
    "“Tourists who travelled to Cyprus, Turkey, Greece or Spain during the past years have grown accustomed to a certain level of comfort,” Alexan Mkrtchian, head of the Pink Elephant tourist agency, said, according to the Interfax news agency. “Only 20 to 30 hotels meet those criteria.”",
    "Mkrtchian noted that a jump in demand provoked a hike in hotel prices that jumped by 50% in Sochi and up to 100% in Crimea, costing a couple of hundreds dollars or more for lodging at an average 4-star hotel.",
    "The flow of visitors to seaside resorts comes at a time when both Russia and Ukraine are continuing to report high daily numbers of new cases.",
    "Russia, which has the world’s fourth-largest coronavirus caseload of more than 687,000 following the United States, Brazil and India, currently registers daily infection numbers topping 6,600. While Moscow has ended a lockdown as contagion dropped, many other regions of the vast country have kept restrictions in place.",
    "Ukraine, which lifted most lockdown measures last month, has seen infections reaching new highs in recent weeks, prompting the authorities to consider re-imposing restrictions in some areas.",
    "In Ukraine’s Odesa, traffic jams at the entrance to the city spread for kilometers (miles), and crowds besiege the city’s night clubs after sunset. Vacationing visitors are flouting rules to wear masks in public and paying little attention to maintaining social distance. Officials are worried about a possible spike in coronavirus infections.",
    "“The Ukrainians are afraid of the coronavirus less than anyone in the world,” said Fazil Askerov, chairman of the Tourism Development Association in the Odesa region. “Our tourists are braver.”",

    "The three public sector oil companies control over 90% of domestic fuel retail trade.",

    "Two people with direct knowledge of fuel pricing matters, requesting anonymity, said that the price rise in the last month also gave an opportunity to state-run oil marketing companies to recover their past losses, as they had frozen fuel rates to provide relief to consumers, who had been distressed by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.",
    "Fuel retailers had frozen petrol and diesel rates since March 16.",
    "However, retail prices were raised on May 5 because the Delhi government had raised the value-added tax (VAT).",
    "Almost all states have raised VAT on petrol and diesel since mid-March to take advantage of low oil prices in the global markets.",
    "One of the persons working in the petroleum ministry said all past dues of oil marketing companies have been already been recovered and the current fuel price hike is purely aligned with international prices of petrol and diesel. ",
    "Diesel prices in Delhi have surpassed petrol because the state government raised VAT on diesel sharply. Even otherwise, internationally, diesel rates are higher than petrol, the person said. ",
    "The Union government raised excise duties on petrol and diesel twice – first on March 14 by Rs 3 per litre each, and later on May 5 by Rs 10 a litre on petrol and Rs 13 on diesel. A Re 1 per litre hike in excise duty meant an additional Rs 14,500 crore revenue to the exchequer.",
    "Consumers could not reap the benefit of the recent oil price slump because both the Centre and states have cornered the entire benefits through higher levies in the forms of central excise and VAT."

    "Whedon was brought in as a replacement for original director Zack Snyder, after Snyder was forced to depart production because of a family tragedy. Whedon, known for directing Marvel’s The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron, was tasked with re-shooting several portions of the film. ",

He was enabled, in many ways, by Geoff Johns and Jon Berg. Accountability>Entertainment,” Fisher wrote. Photographer Clay Enos, who has collaborated with Snyder on several projects, tweeted in response to Fisher’s statement, “I heard the same thing.”",
    "Reporter Grace Randolph added to the allegations and said that Gal Gadot refused to shoot a comedic scene in which The Flash lands on her body, and Whedon persisted by bringing in a body double to shoot the scene instead. “I doubt we’ll ever get specifics from Ray Fisher re Joss Whedon, but here’s one I was the first to report: Gal Gadot didn’t want to film this scene, so Whedon did it w/ a stunt double. That’s why you can’t see her face,” Randolph wrote. ",

Photographer Jason Laboy, who has worked with Fisher, tweeted, “Don’t forget to add that he locked her in a room and threatened her career if she didn’t do the scene. That is very important and should not be omitted.”",
    "Filmmaker Kevin Smith on the Fatman Beyond podcast, recalling what he’d been told by someone who worked on both versions of the film, said, “The special effects guy said there was a fair amount of trash-talking of Zack’s version of the movie on-set by Joss. Again, this is what a special effects guy who worked on both versions of the movie told me. But that [Whedon] would cut down, dismiss, and be negative about Zack’s version, which he had seen and all these people had made together without him and stuff.”",

    "Whedon has offered ‘no comment’ on the controversy, and producer Jon Berg has said that Fisher’s complaints arose from the fact that he was made to say a catchphrase that he wasn’t on board with. Snyder’s version of Justice League will be released on HBO Max in 2021, after massive fan pressure. ",
